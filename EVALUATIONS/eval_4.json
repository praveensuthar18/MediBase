                " Skin allergy due to cold and allergic cough Excuse me Dr. Since 6 months m suffering from cold skin allergy and allergic cough with asthma. Im using fexofenadine for cough and levocetrizine for allergy. If i will come to contact with cold immediately i develope hives. And m jus avoiding cold and using those antihistamine and fexa so  what can i do for complete recovery? And my ESR rate is also high its 25 what can i do for that? Need some suggestion for good prognosis.Hello and hope you are doing well.    Understand your predicament. Environmental triggers for allergic reactions like changes in weather  temperature and water sources are difficult to avoid  but being aware can help you take adequate precautions. As you are aware of the triggers please avoid them or take anti-histamines. If the present anti histamines are not very effective you can consult your doctor for long acting ones.    Hope this helped and do keep us posted.Thank u for ur advice. Actually it happen to me since 5 yrs ago at that time i have done all the test too and due to treatment i felt good and i was feeling recovered but again it re appear since 5 months ago....... Anyway i will go through ur suggestion once.  .Hello and hope you are doing well.    Looks like your allergic responses are causing rash  Allergic Rhinitis & Asthma. Consult an allergy specialist. First he may do a blood IgE levels to see if they are raised. Next  he will do skin testing. This test is painless  in which a very small amount of certain allergens are pricked into the surface of your skin. If you have allergies  just a little swelling will occur where the allergen was introduced.  Reactions occur within about 15 minutes.  If needed more sensitive intradermal tests will be used in which a small amount of allergen is injected within the skin. Based on this he may plan for immunotherapy.     Hope this helped and do keep us posted."

My tongue gets inflammed coating on my tongue and my stomach bloats with also quite bad gas. It sometimes happen when I eat certain things throughout the day could this be an allergy?Thanks I'm trying to get tests done as we speak because It does seem to happen around certain foods however not all the time. I've noticed one thing that does it is Milk so I've managed to cut that out so far. I will update on how it goes :)Hello  I'm no expert but I myself do suffer from a few allergies myself  The main symptoms that occur are some like: sickness  vomiting   an outbreak of hives  swelling of certain areas of the body(for me its my throat)  rashes. I personally think that you shouldn't disregard this theory and maybe have a blood test just to be sure but it sounds more like food intolerance  so you may be able to eat a certain amount of food but anymore will give you the symptoms you are experiencing  but as I say I'm no expert.  kind regards (hope you get better soon!) H    Hi  what you are experiencing could be food intolerance. These symptoms are generally less serious and are limited to digestive problems. If you have a food intolerance  you may be able to eat small amounts of the offending food without trouble. There could be many reasons for this  like IBS  lactose intolerance  celiac disease and sensitivity to food additives. Sometimes the mere thought of a food may make you sick. The reason is not fully understood. Regards.   "

                " Food Allergy and Diarrhea For a mild food allergy  would the diarrhea associated occur within an hour or two of ingestion  or would it occur the following day? How long after ingesting food does the diarrhea usually occur?Hello and hope you are doing well.    You could be sensitive to the quantity too. Some people develop symptoms based on the amount of allergen ingested.     Hope this helped and do keep us posted.   Hello~It usually occurs about an hour or so later  but  it can occur sooner  or it can occur much later  I really think it all depends on the individual and what was eaten.It really depends on the person and how sensitive they are. I'm lactose intolerant and I usually know an hour after I have something if someone put so much as butter on it. If someone mixes up my coffee I know in 10 minutes because the bloating gets so bad.     I'd also imagine food allergies don't act that much differently from other allergies- I'm allergic to fragrance but it could take a couple hours or days for me to experience symptoms. I'm also extremely allergic to lavender- it would take minutes for my skin to swell up and less than 2 hours for me to get hives.    So it would really depend on two things: how allergic that person is to a specific thing and how much of the allergen is ingested. Also not all allergies and intolerance shows up with diarrhea- you could also get bloating  rashes  swelling  nausea  headaches  etc.     If you think you're experiencing an allergic reaction to something  don't have it again (if you know what it is). You can also talk to the dr who can help you find out what you may be allergic to and depending on the amount of reaction- how much you are allergic to it. "

                " delayed milk allergy ?! My 5yr. Old son has had tummy problems since a year old. Periods of stomach bug like symptoms lasting few days then disappear. However this yr. This cycle has became a monthly thing. Begins with vomiting always early am. Usually 3to4am. Continued that day then diarrhea for approx 4 to 5 days. Recently a GI diagnosed possible DELAYED MILK Allergy. He does keep a mild bumpy rash on upper arms. My concern is can this type of allergy really cause this type of cycle? I would think he would have more symptoms closer together. We began NO milk protein diet& scheduled MRI next month. Will MRI only show brain or can they see intestinal problems as well?of course you could get a intolerance everytime. There's no fact to say like  oh yes yesterday I had to much milk  probably I'm going to be intolerant soon..  It can happen all the time. But don't worry about it. Nowadays there are so many supplements available. Also there are milk products without lactose  so you should be fine :)Sometimes allergies can take a few hours to manifest themselves  this certainly seems like a type of allergy or food sensitivity however.

                " weird water allergy  i'm very worried!! Sorry for my english  I am a 21 year old female from Greece.  In 20 July 2013 I was in a small island  at the beach enjoying myself. As I got out of the water a friend asked me what is wrong with my face and I realised that it was RED on the cheeks and the nose  on the forehead and on my chin! They were big red patches united together (just redness withn no elevation and not single lesions)...By the time I was in the pharmacist's the red patches were gone...This happened to me every day that I went swimming. I have to note that during my vacation days I had NO problems with showering or washing my face. In the end of August I returned to my home town. A week after my return home  I started getting hives (1-2cm flat red areas with an elevated center)  about 3-4 of them on my body (since I was a child I used to get these) and many many more on my face and neck every time I take a shower no matter what the temperature of the water. They disappear in about 20 minutes after I get out of the shower. It's not only in MY shower  cause it has happened to me after showering at my boyfriend's house too! I might also get one spot if my boyfriend touches me with sweaty skin. I have NO problems with drinking water of any kind (tap water  filtered water  bottled water). Experimenting  I tried to wash my face with hot  warm and cold tap water: the same effects. BUT when I washed it with filtered water I had NO symptoms.

                " Sorry for my english  I am a 21 year old female from Greece.  In 20 July 2013 I was in a small island  at the beach enjoying myself. As I got out of the water a friend asked me what is wrong with my face and I realised that it was RED on the cheeks and the nose  on the forehead and on my chin! They were big red patches united together (just redness withn no elevation and not single lesions)...By the time I was in the pharmacist's the red patches were gone...This happened to me every day that I went swimming. I have to note that during my vacation days I had NO problems with showering or washing my face. In the end of August I returned to my home town. A week after my return home  I started getting hives (1-2cm flat red areas with an elevated center)  about 3-4 of them on my body (since I was a child I used to get these) and many many more on my face and neck every time I take a shower no matter what the temperature of the water. They disappear in about 20 minutes after I get out of the shower. It's not only in MY shower  cause it has happened to me after showering at my boyfriend's house too! I might also get one spot if my boyfriend touches me with sweaty skin. I have NO problems with drinking water of any kind (tap water  filtered water  bottled water). Experimenting  I tried to wash my face with hot  warm and cold tap water: the same effects. BUT when I washed it with filtered water I had NO symptoms. I also noticed that by decreasing the time I spend in the shower or wash my face they decrease in number or don't show up at all. I had hives for about a year when I was little but we finally found out it was the washing powder my mom washed the clothes with  I am still allergic to cats without hives but I sneeze a lot when they touch me and once my tongue was swollen due to allergy to an antibiotic.

It could indicate a food allergy. As repeated episodes have occurred with consumption of the same food. It may help to maintain a food dairy and keep monitoring your symptoms. This will help to narrow the search and avoid them. Further allergic testing may be worth looking into. Here an allergy specialist may confirm the allergic reaction and can further help to desensitize you.     Hope this helped and do keep us posted.   I think it's some kind of reaction yes. Probably best to avoid them now if this is what happens every time you eat them."

                " Quinine Allergy Hi there     I believe I have an allergy to Quinine. Last time I drank tonic water  my nose and lips swelled up and a rash formed on my back. At first  I though it was the Gin that may have done this  but I recently drank tonic water and whiskey (dont ask me why...) and these allergies occured once again. Once the swelling came down  my mouth became littered with cankersores which causes eating and drinking to be very painful. I have eaten grapefruits (I have heard they contain Quinine) many times with no reaction. Does tonic water have more quinine than grapefruits? Is this why I react to tonic water and not grapefruits? What other substances contain quinine  other than malaria treatments? Any help would be much appreciated.    ThanksMy quinine allergy caused seizure swelling and a lichenoid drug eruption.  Lichen Planus was only discovered after a biopsy on the blisters which I thought were hives. So if you are breaking out in what you think are canker sores or other skin blisters  ask for a biopsy to be sure. Many people are misdiagnosed with herpes or eczema/psoriasis like I was.  If I drink Tonic Water  even a small amount  I get severe hives  my skin welts up in puffy pink at the slightest touch  and my hands and feet swell as well as my wrists. I go to hospital for Presnizone and anti-hystamine like Benedryl. It lasts for about 10 days  then a layer of skin peels off my feet bottoms and hand palms.  I had a much less severe reaction from a drink of Vermouth  just itchy  sensitive skin. I had 5 incidents over 30 years  and it took me this long to what determine what caused the allergy  as I like a large variety of foods and beverages  but I was able to pinpoint with certainty that it is tonic water ingredient.Hi guys we are allergic to quinine which is in tonic water. So we should not drink tonic or consume anything containing quinine. But in any case if you drink tonic and face the allergic  symptoms take fenistil pills which are antihistaminic.Me too...I took 2 quinine tablets about a week ago two nights apart for severe leg cramps......subsequently my upper lip swelled to twice it's normalsize and now the bottom lip matches..I also have numeroud water blisters that have formed between my big toes and second toes on bo9th feet.  This morning I am having under the skin water bubbles between my ring and middle finger.  I am now positive that it is due to the quinine.I would like to back your experience up with my own.  I had traveled to the UK to visit family and was flying home when I had my first in-flight nausea. I had asked for tonic and orange juice for beverages when they were handed out.  Shortly after the second drink I started to fell nauseous with a focused headache in my forehead. At the time I attributed the sickness to possible tummy bug that had been going round the family- now I'm not so sure.     Additionally  Last night I was out with friends for a birthday party and had 2 Vodka and tonics at a nice bar.  I've never been so ill and miserable except maybe once before due to food poisoning.  My friends and family confirmed I was shakey  couldn't stay warm and had no balance.  I was up vomiting and heaving for about 2 hours.  I decided to not take medical action in the end because I was not in shock  was able to warm up  manage some liquids and my partner was home to help me.I know I have an allergy to quinine. The first time I had tonic water  I had it with vodka. After only two sips I started feeling nauseous. I didn't finish the drink yet spent that night vomiting violently. I attributed it to vodka which I had never had before. A few years later I had my second taste of tonic water  this time in a gin and tonic. After 2 or 3 sips I started feeling nauseous again and everything went black for a few seconds. Later I tried tonic water with no alcohol and  sure enough  I had instant nausea. Doctors aren't convinced  but I KNOW.Hi   Quinine is a flavour component of tonic water  bitter lemon  and vermouth. According to tradition  the bitter taste of anti-malarial quinine tonic led British colonials in India to mix it with gin  thus creating the gin and tonic cocktail  which is still popular today in many parts of the world.  In some areas non-medical use of quinine is regulated  in the United States (by the Food and Drug Administration ) and in Germany quinine is limited to between 83-85 parts per million (83-85 mg/kg)  [10] which is 0.5% to 0.25% the concentration used in therapeutic tonic.  In Canada  quinine is an ingredient in the carbonated chinotto beverage called Brio.  In the United Kingdom  Scottish company A.G. Barr's uses quinine as an ingredient in the carbonated and caffeinated beverage Irn-Bru.  In England  Australia and New Zealand  quinine is an ingredient in Schweppes and other Indian Tonic waters  at a concentration of 0.5%.  ref:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinine  Since you are allergic to it stay away from tonics and take OTC anti-histamines to treat allergic symptoms.  You're symptoms are almost identical to mine.  It took me a year and a half to pinpoint the reaction to tonic water.  When I first saw my primary doctor because of the cankersores  he originally diagnosed it as oral herpes.  After a couple other outbreaks and a quinine suspicion  I saw an allergist and the patch test and scratch test for quinine was negative.  The final test was to drink a glass of tonic.  Sure enough  20 mins later  red swollen lips and a couple rashes elsewhere.  He was very surprised (I don't think he believed me)  and said he'd never encountered this sensitivity before.  He called it a fixed drug eruption  which is fixed because the site(s) of reaction are the same spots every time.    I have found that the reactions get worse every time  to the point where it lasts a week now.  My advice is to stay far away from quinine!    As far as grapefruits  I'm not aware of any quinine in grapefruits  quick search on google suggests that it may have quinine like properties.  But I have no reaction to grapefruit.  There is a drug called Quinidine used as a heart medication.  Just tell your doctors that you have an allergy to Quinine.    Hope this helps  best of luck. "

                " Life after Hepatitis C Treatment Can you say one thing that has adversely effected your health from hepatitis C treatment?  I know there are lots we feel.  But what stands out the most?    Oct  2014  I completed 3rd round of tx. 2006  interferon and ribavirin. 2012  triple tx  incivek  interferon ribavirin. On January 22 I will do the 3 month viral load test to see if I beat it. It feels as though I have. The pain around my liver is gone. I am left with fatigue  fibromyalgia and poor focus. From laying on the sofa 3 months I gained 10 lbs. Sometimes I experience a  little depression. But I exercise daily and eat lots of greens and healthy foods because I am determined to feel better. I think my body was missing the hep c for a while after 3rd tx. I had heart palps and irregular heart beats. Those symptoms have subsided. I have found that doctors don't acknowledge symptoms from post tx. Not sure why..maybe fear of malpractice. Maybe they don't have the answers.  I believe I can do anything because the virus is gone. Our bodies have the ability to heal.  Hi   I'm new here  just stumbled across the forum which is a great source ofinfor.    Anyways.    I was diagnosed witth hep c  type 3 and endured 24 weeks of hell.  I was treated with interferon and ribavirin btw.I am now 3 years post completing tx and still feel fatigued  unmotivated  have memory problems  brain fog  and low attention span at times.    I was wondering if this is normal?  I get told by health professionals that this shouldnt happen and nobody seems to acknowledge that this could even be a factor of post tx.Thank you so much for sharing  it means a lot to many people.  DeeWelcome to the forum.   Glad to hear you final cleared (SVR).   Was your last treatment Peg and Interferon?   Yes the memory issues can be an issue but not everyone is effected.   You are at two years and It can take time to recover.   I honestly though I was never going to recover.   But amazingly things started improving.   This is what I found helped.  Don't drink alcohol   drink enough water for your body weigh everyday  get lots of sleep and eat health food.  I found that when I stopped eating all fast food my memory really improved.  This is why I think this is all important.   Hepatitis C treatment and food additives tax your liver.   You need to be very kind to that liver and the rest of your body.   Really kind.  I put a real effort into doing this and my memory and platlets improved greatly.   All of a sudden my health really started improving.   You completed treatment 3 months after me.  It's only now I'm feeling major improvement.    one major thing is memory loss. having to learn things all over again. Should there be a class action for something that saved our lives?Hello   I treated 3x old alpha 2/ ribo 6 mos  same weeks ( almost died twice cause dose too high wiped out red  white cells and started on bone marrow)  3rd treat one year end 1/2013  cleared and fibro is worse  very tired   memory loss and ADHD have escalated. Not sure but seems we all have interferon or pegasys in common. While Interferon never cleared me of the virus  I do feel that I have been helped with all the different treatments I did using the interferon.  I feel that they helped me to not progress in fibrosis scores  as I might have had I not done all those treatments.  With that said  I've had definite changes in my brain functions.  I had a skin disorder that is defined as an orphan disease and there's no cure  this according to a skin biopsy by my dermatologist and then  she referred me to a hematologist/oncologist for another view point. She wanted me to see him to make sure it wasn't caused by a serious systemic disease. He ran a bunch more defined tests and said it wasn't caused by systemic disease  but the it was his opinion that it was caused by the interferon or Hep C.  In a nut shell  I get hives whenever I get in direct sunlight for any period of time more than light 10 min. I don't get them just walking back and forth to my car in like a tank top and shorts. But  if I'm standing out in the sunlight in that  for 10 min. or longer  I end up with the red itching rash and this is including off of treatment.  It also is aggravated by like a lengthy hot shower or bath.  I can get in a warm shower for like a couple of min(2 min.)  but  then  have to switch the warm to cold. So no hot tubs for me.  Obviously  this is not fun for me  but I've learned to live with it after all these years. At least when it's cool (not freezing) cold outside  I can get outside and walk w/o being uncomfortable because then  I can wear long sleeves and long pants and not be sweating  like crazy  like I would be in the 80+ degree temps in that garb.  The brain functioning has been very frustrating.  Me trying to follow directions is ridiculous. I don't understand written directions  like that come with a piece of equipment or something you buy at store  new technology  etc. Me trying to learn something new-I also get very confused.  When I'm trying to drive somewhere unfamiliar  I get a big anxiety attack because I've gotten lost a bunch of times. I didn't used to be this way prior to interferon.  I also used to work early on like treatments 1-4 but with my having done 12 treatments every one of them with interferon  I was no longer able to function in a working environment  so I ended up o SSDI - this is the one that you pay into during your working years..  not the SSI.  Fortunately  I worked enough years to earn enough credits to qualify for this type because you make a slightly more amount of money o SSDI (depending on what your wages were while you were working)  than you do on SSI.  Anyhow  I got denied the first and second times  but on the 3rd attempt  I did it with an attorney. It wasn't granted based on my HEP C alone because I wasn't cirrhotic  but it was granted based on my 'failing' the mental tests (done by the Soc. Sec. doctors) and added to the Hep C and fibromylagia-type of aches and pains I have.  Many people think that you get all this money 'for nothing' when you're on disability.  That's a big crock.  You will never get rich on SSDI. The fact is  you barely make enough to survive.  I wouldn't survive on it w/o my husband's income to help.  Don't know many people that can survive on under 15 000 a year take home and I still pay taxes on that and I still pay for my Medicare Advantage (health ins.)  or I did..  but I've changed my coverage and starting Jan. 1st  I dropped their drug coverage and will just use my husband's work insurance's prescription drug plan  because it pays better. Now since I have dropped the drug coverage part of my Medicare Advantage  I will go from paying $90 a month to a $0 premium.  All  I'll use that plan for will be like a medical/hospitalization coverage. My husband's work insurance Cigna covers everthing better than a Medicare Adv. plan anyway.  But  I know I've drifted off topic... sorry .  Susan400Good thread!  I have mentioned on other threads that:    I treated with 7 Mo of Interferon (3 x wk).      Worst residual symptom was short term memory loss.  I used to have total recall EXCEPT for  interestingly enough  names.  I have never been able to remember those.      aFter I thought about it and decided getting bitter wasn't going to change anything  I just figured that was the 'cost of doing business' and got on with my life - developed a lot of 'crutches' over the years to help me remember/remind me.  My favorite was a calendar w/ enough space to make notes  that I carried everywhere.  NOW I use my IPad calendar for that.    PatI know I responded to this before but wanted to change my answer.  The one thing that still bothers me post tx is my cognitive abilities.  The ability to pull a name out of my hat.  I always had a very good memory pre tx and while I still have it in there someplace at times I get very flustered when I say or do the wrong thing or the opposite of what I mean to do.  It upsets me very much.  I am thinking of trying an ADD medication as I have read others have done on here.  I guess I first need to find out what kind of doctor I need to see.    First time in 2008 I did Pegasys  Riba and a polymerase inhibitor  Second 2011 did Pegintron  Riba  Incivek.    There was a big difference between the first and second tx.  The first tx took me two years to recover from during which time I lost my job because I could no longer work full time.  6 hours was the most I could do after relapsing.oops  so sorry  I forgot to answer I was on Incivek triple.  The worst was the fatigue tying with brain fogYes thank you for sharing  something I noticed early in treatment  we had to become proactive  something I never experienced within the medical field. The always say your pharmacists would realize the problems with combinations of drugs the doctor's prescribe their patient s            Hi Nan  thank you for sharing this information.  I am so that you found out what the problem was.  It seems really irresponsible that no one knew.  When I treated I had to tell them every visit what I was taking.  The Incivek was so new that my doctor did not know that some of my medications would be blocked by Incivek.    I am really sorry for what you and your husband have gone through  DeeMy husband went through 5 weeks of triple treatment with Incivik pre-tranplant.  He had decompensated cirrhosis at the time and frankly  it almost killed him.  He got very anemic and needed repeated blood transfusions. He almost went into kidney failure. Based on that experience  I would not recommend that treatment to anyone especially now that there are easier treatments available with higher cure rates.    Now he is on Sovaldi + Ribavirin for 24 weeks.  If you have been reading my posts  you know he has had ongoing episodes of hepatic encephalopathy.  It has been  extremely debilitating for him and he ended up hospitalized twice in the last 11 weeks.  I thought it was related to the procrit shots he was getting weekly to increase his hgb. Ribavirin can cause hemolysis or the breakup of rbc's which beings more toxins into the bloodstream. After the shots were stopped I expected an improvement in the HE.  That didn't happen. Turns out  it was the medicine he was taking to stop the HE (Xifaxin)!  It's an antibiotic that's not supposed to get into the bloodstream but it apparently did. The result was an increase in his episodes of HE instead of a decrease.  The prescriving information for Sovaldi warns against taking \"rifampin\". Turns out Xifaxin is a structural analog of rifampin.    He stopped the Xifaxin last Friday. He has NOT had an episode of HE since.  I see he is still fatigued but is getting stronger every day.  We were very close to stopping the HCV treatment because of the episodes of HE. But now that the HE episodes are gone   it looks like he will actually be able to finish the whole 24 weeks.    I hope our experience will help someone else out there. I called Gilead today to let them know what happened and asked them to include a warning about Xifaxin on their prescribing information.    Bottom line  I didn't think so because of the HE episodes  but now that we know it actually the mixing of two medicines that should not have been mixed the new HCV treatment is much easier than than the triple treatment he took previously.    Nan@ 28 weeks post  48 weeks interferon and riba. like cheflady said \" my life\". But to answer your question  the one thing...fatigue.   All others seem to be related to not having enough energy to work through them. I believe the more mobile I become the quicker I recover.    Hubby 12mth post tx he treated with riba interferon& INCIVEK for 24wks hope that helps you Love Jules xMY LIFEtreated with peg interferon and riba in 2006. main sides are fatigue pain and mental deficits-confusion attention deficit and brain fog.Nan  I treated with Incivek  Ribavirin and Interferon.   I'm interested in how different it is for those on new treatment too.  Will be interesting how long the post sides last.Informative thread.  Can the posters answering please write what treatment they are talking about? I'd like to know if the new treatments have similar post treatment symptoms as the older treatments.    Nan  Sorry you had all those side effects  but the doctors must have known for years  but kept passing out the poisons.  Many people injured.  All these years all I hear is the sides are \"flu-like.\"  Yeah  right.  edit    \u2026 even fasted for 5 days (only water and juice) and I still gained xxxxx weight!?!?!?!    p.s. it is sooooo late here and I have been really working on a number of projects - we should have an edit button for these timed - UGH!  lol    nite all  If ya really want me to put it into one thing I would have to say \"The destruction of my life! which is based on a great number of things including chronic fatigue  chronic pain  and then there are great mysteries such as massive weight gain even though I exercise and diet daily *I know it doesn't make any kind of sense!

                " What is it? \t        Hi  everyone - newbie here.        About ten years ago my lips would swell in the middle of the night - not often  and controlled by taking a couple of benedryl.        Five years ago I had my first anaphylactic reaction to food. It started about six hours after I'd eaten. First  diarrhea  then hives and horrible itching all over. I was treated and released from the ER. The figured I was allergic to shrimp because we'd had deep fried shrimp for dinner. The next night I was back in the ER - the doc had no idea why I would have another reaction while on prednisone and benedryl.        A couple of weeks later my insurance ran out  so I never had the opportunity to consult an allergist.        Fast forward three years. I tried shrimp again  and had no problems. In fact  I'd had no allergic reactions to anything. Still no insurance  so I was thankful that it hadn't happened again. I was visiting a friend one weekend in Sacramento. We had Chipotle for lunch  an asian chicken salad for dinner and a couple of bottles of red wine between us. I woke up at 3 am with diarrhea  then the itching started and my face began to swell. My friend called an ambulance and I was taken to the ER. (Funny story at the end of that visit  but not pertinient at the moment!)        Three months later I finally had insurance (I don't care what anyone says  Obamacare saved my life!) and I started seeing an allergist.        Through blood testing  we've found that I'm allergic to tree nuts  sesame and sunflower. I've been trying so hard to stay away from those things - sunflower is the hardest since it's an ingredient in many ingredients.        The problem is  I'm still having reactions on occasion  even though I KNOW I have not ingested any of my known allergens. My allergist is also puzzled as to why my reactions always occur about six hours after I eat my last meal of the day. 3 am is my witching time.... She sent me to a GI doc who found no problems with gluten or any other GI concerns.        HELP!! Is it also possible to have an allergy to vegetable oil? How do you know? It seems that one time I'll eat something and I'm fine  and another time I eat the same thing and I'm in the ER.        How do you all live this way? I'm having a hard time....     hi :)      welcome to medhelp :)    well  I had almost the same problems. And I got tested positive to histamine 2 years ago. But I found a dietary supplement called Daosin  its against histamine intolerance. But you need to be tested also! I don't wanna recommend it to you if you are not intolerant to histamine even if you can buy it easy online.     Its pretty easy  you need to take a cap right before you eat and its avoiding the allergic reaction.  )Hello     I can relate to your frustrations. I have experienced them myself. Food allergies can be the pits to control and to find. Some days  a person is OK  then others  no way.    For me  it was stress that was causing the fluctuations in the way I could handle the so-called allergies. I know when the body is in flight-or-fight  our immune system is weakened and this can cause allergies to things we were normally never allergic to in the first place.    I do know that our allergies can change about every 3 to 5 years. They can also return for apparently no reason.    As to allergy to vegetable oils  yes  it is possible  especially if it is soy based. So many people have soy allergies  myself included  if this is the case  you will be adding allergens to all you eat and feel rotten. If possible  try experimenting with different oils and see how you feel."
