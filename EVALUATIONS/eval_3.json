I understand and I have had PND so think I could not breath....this is y I asked about this issue....     U may want to talk to ur Drs about using a med that may help  just in case it is allergy based.sorry but is pnd post nasal drip lol sorry its pretty scary    Yes  I am aware u may have the symptoms during the day as well  but to help u sleep better .....     it is possible that during the day u have PND as a result of the GERD that can cause thick mucus to block breathing....     It is important since u have this symptom that u get testing to know y u have it and treat it.actually i forgot i can have it during day when im awakethank u    Hi...this can be a typical symptom for GERD/acid reflux so trying to sleep in a bed that is elevated may help....but Baed is right it could also indicate Sleep apnea and u do not want to ignore that so do see ur Dr asap and have testing to determine which it is.One should be careful though because this could be a symptom of sleep apnea as well.This used to happen to me before I even knew I had GERD. I would wake up in coughing fits and gasping for air. About a month later  I was diagnosed with GERD/LPR and put 2 and 2 together  and realized that's what all that was about."

                " 16 year old wakes up choking  gasping  belting  spitting. 2 weeks ago at 11:30 pm my healthy 16 yr old who had a dry cough for the previous week started gasping for air while showering. After a scary couple of minutes and paramedics on the way  he slowly regained breathing and started deeply belching and spitting. ER said it was likely bronchitis that caused bronchspasm and gave him a steroid dose pack. 3 days later it happened again same time of night at a friends house and was taken to another ER. They said it was reflux and gave him zantac. Pediatrician is sending him to a pulmonologist but suspects it is his larynx spasming. She gave him an inhaler in the meantime. We also have referrals to ENT and GI. Does anyone know anything about this? It\u2019s now happening every night while he is sleeping. He shoots up gasping for air and as he regains breaths starts belching and spitting a lot. Same thing every time. I have him taking Zantac twice a day and Claritin once a day. Hope to get to bottom if this. It will take some time to get to all the specialists but wondered if anyone had any insight. Thank you!!UPDATE.... if anyone sees this.... it\u2019s laryngospasm per pulmonologist. He likely damaged his vocal chords when he had a bad cough which was likely bronchitis. May take a while to heal. Going to ENT also. On 150 mugs twice a day if Zantac and 24 hr Claritin at night. Attacks have subsided in severity but still occurring every night. There\u2019s som other good feeds about this on this site that I\u2019ve read meticulously. At least he\u2019s not alone. "

For the last 3 months I\u2019ve only had diarrhea and no normal BMs. Just this morning I realized I stopped a pain led  morphine er around the time this started. I\u2019ve always had diarrhea for sometimes a couple weeks in a row  but never this long. In the last couple months I have started bloating after eating  feel like I\u2019m ready to get sick or vomit  get a little SOB (different issue) and feel churning in my stomach and intestines. Sometimes when bloated my belly is really hard. I found that if I use a little Mylanta and an anti gas pill then a bit later I can start feeling better   But not always. If this happens at breakfast I will usually be bloated and feel full all day. Sometimes if I have a BM it improves it  and sometimes a hefty belch and I\u2019ll feel better. I eat pretty well as I have diabetes. I have also noticed if I do eat something with a lot of sugar (yes I cheat occasionally) that is when it\u2019s the worst. I had my worst bout of it last night. I\u2019m just wondering if this can all be attributed to IBS or not. Any information would be greatly appreciated. It could be  or it might be something else. (Yeah  lousy answer  I know.)     It could be a reaction to a certain food  or a type of food  or a drink  or anything else you put in your body. It could be a food allergy or sensitivity. Have you ever had testing done?    It could also be IBS. The thing about IBS is that it seems like we can eat something one day  and be fine  and the next time we eat it  we suffer for it.     You're 55 - have you ever had a colonoscopy? That can help rule things out.     Are you under the care of a gastroenterologist? If you aren't  now would be a good time to get one.     "

                " Difficulty breathing  excessive yawning and burping Hello   I am a healthy 33 year old female. For the past 2 weeks I have had some difficulty breathing  excessive yawning and burping.  I feel like I can't get enough air in with each breath.    I am yawning aprox- 15-10 times and hour but I am not tired.  I am also burping a lot or feeling the need to burp and like I have a lump in my throat.  Once in a while  I get a really good breath in.  It doesn't seem to be exacerbated with exercise.  Actually  it is worst when I am sitting down working or reading.  If I am distractred  it seems to not bother me as much.    I have had this problem before but it only lasted a day or 2 and not to this severity.  My nurse practitioner thought it was GERD or an asthma exacerbation.  I have been taking Prilosec for a week but I can't tell a difference. My oxygen sat was 99%.    I have found many forums of people with this same problem  they describe exactally the same symptoms I am having but noone seems to know what it is.  They have so many expensive labs and tests done to no avail.  Do you have any suggestions?Hello did yiu find iut what is it? I am having the same problem thanksHi TimmyNes .. I had the same symptoms but with a cough that suddenly began. I was a smoker. An xray indicated Emphysema. I am yet to have blood tests which will help confirm or discount diagnosis.         Since this is an older thread try creating a new one with all that is going on with you.....to read thru all these to find out what same symptoms you identify with can be daunting for the members and you may not get the answers you are looking for.     Hi all I have been suffering with the same symptoms for the past 5 days now. Doc told me in hyperventilating. Can any of you tell me if this got better for you? Thank youI feel the same...that lump in my throat that makes me burp all the time. And i cant take enough air to breath.@chelsj and @eliz90  I have been having the exact same problem... I have had IBS for 15 years  and over the last few years have developed excessive burping  and now over the last month or so it has turned into excessive burping and yawning. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! I am also a female in my 30s...@chelj Did you ever find out what the problem was? I have a very similar story  and would appreciate any insight! :) Hello. I am a 23 year old male. I weigh approx 195 and am 5'8 so I am a tad heavy for my height. I have recently started losing weight (I was 230 about 5 months ago so progess is being made!) and I have started having these symptoms EXACTLY. Started about a month ago and have been to the doc mutliple times for it. I do have GERD and take prilosec for it (though I am pretty inconsistant with it..I will feel good for a few days so I don't take it then when I start getting the acid burn in my abdoment/chest I'll start taking it again). I have been to the doc previously  about a year ago now  about waking up choking and having a burning feeling in my lungs (this was due to the GERD getting so bad that I would aspirate). But recently it has been the shortness of breath (air hunger)  constant yawning and when I burp (burping is also tough to do now) it feels like pressure is being taken off of my lungs and it becomes a little easier to breathe  this is short lived  however. I also get the lump feeling in my throat and it seems as though throat lozenges (spelling?) alleviate that feeling for a short time. Could all this be caused by GERD?I also have been experiencing this since jan 1st 2014. I have been diagnosed by a holistic doctor with Dysbiosis (imbalance of gut bacteria). This was due to repeated antibiotic use and high sugar diet (processed foods and alcohol too). I have taken antibacterials such as garlic  berberine and oregano oil and probiotics to treat this and had some improvement but as soon as I stopped taking them I relapsed and symptoms returned. I have since done a fecal transplant and was starting to feel  Much better for 6 weeks then relapsed again. I am about to have more fecal transplants to prolong my feeling of wellbeing and hopefully improve my health on a deep level.

                " Hello did yiu find iut what is it? I am having the same problem thanks;Hi TimmyNes .. I had the same symptoms but with a cough that suddenly began. I was a smoker. An xray indicated Emphysema. I am yet to have blood tests which will help confirm or discount diagnosis.     ;    Since this is an older thread try creating a new one with all that is going on with you.....to read thru all these to find out what same symptoms you identify with can be daunting for the members and you may not get the answers you are looking for.     ;Hi all I have been suffering with the same symptoms for the past 5 days now. Doc told me in hyperventilating. Can any of you tell me if this got better for you? Thank you;I feel the same...that lump in my throat that makes me burp all the time. And i cant take enough air to breath.;@chelsj and @eliz90  I have been having the exact same problem... I have had IBS for 15 years  and over the last few years have developed excessive burping  and now over the last month or so it has turned into excessive burping and yawning. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! I am also a female in my 30s...;@chelj Did you ever find out what the problem was? I have a very similar story  and would appreciate any insight! :) ;Hello. I am a 23 year old male. I weigh approx 195 and am 5'8 so I am a tad heavy for my height. I have recently started losing weight (I was 230 about 5 months ago so progess is being made!) and I have started having these symptoms EXACTLY. Started about a month ago and have been to the doc mutliple times for it. I do have GERD and take prilosec for it (though I am pretty inconsistant with it..I will feel good for a few days so I don't take it then when I start getting the acid burn in my abdoment/chest I'll start taking it again). I have been to the doc previously  about a year ago now  about waking up choking and having a burning feeling in my lungs (this was due to the GERD getting so bad that I would aspirate). But recently it has been the shortness of breath (air hunger)  constant yawning and when I burp (burping is also tough to do now) it feels like pressure is being taken off of my lungs and it becomes a little easier to breathe  this is short lived  however. I also get the lump feeling in my throat and it seems as though throat lozenges (spelling?) alleviate that feeling for a short time. Could all this be caused by GERD?;I also have been experiencing this since jan 1st 2014. I have been diagnosed by a holistic doctor with Dysbiosis (imbalance of gut bacteria). This was due to repeated antibiotic use and high sugar diet (processed foods and alcohol too). I have taken antibacterials such as garlic  berberine and oregano oil and probiotics to treat this and had some improvement but as soon as I stopped taking them I relapsed and symptoms returned. I have since done a fecal transplant and was starting to feel  Much better for 6 weeks then relapsed again. I am about to have more fecal transplants to prolong my feeling of wellbeing and hopefully improve my health on a deep level.

                " Hello   I am a healthy 33 year old female. For the past 2 weeks I have had some difficulty breathing  excessive yawning and burping.  I feel like I can't get enough air in with each breath.    I am yawning aprox- 15-10 times and hour but I am not tired.  I am also burping a lot or feeling the need to burp and like I have a lump in my throat.  Once in a while  I get a really good breath in.  It doesn't seem to be exacerbated with exercise.  Actually  it is worst when I am sitting down working or reading.  If I am distractred  it seems to not bother me as much.    I have had this problem before but it only lasted a day or 2 and not to this severity.  My nurse practitioner thought it was GERD or an asthma exacerbation.  I have been taking Prilosec for a week but I can't tell a difference. My oxygen sat was 99%.    I have found many forums of people with this same problem  they describe exactally the same symptoms I am having but noone seems to know what it is.  They have so many expensive labs and tests done to no avail.  Do you have any suggestions?"

                " Sinus Issues - Mild Nose Bleeds and Coughing Up Blood Hi. I'm a 54 yr old female. I often get mild nose bleeds and post nasal drip. I was just wondering how common it is to possibly swallow a small amount of blood from nose. The other morning i coughed and saw a piece of bloody mucus. It was a small amount and my nose was bleeding mildly also. I feel like this has happened to me in the past but now that I'm getting older I'm worrying more about stuff. My daughter said that has happened to her a few times too. Anyone relate? Would appreciate any feedback. Thanks.What to do depends on how often  and how severe the bleeding is.  The cause is likely to be dry air.  Which can result in more frequent bloody noses in heating season  and the latter part of the air conditioning season...  The dryness inside the nasal passages can be irritated and promote cracking and bleeding.  Nasel gel such as NeilMed (TM) can be a great help!  If you still get frequent nose bleeds  See an ENT specialist.  In my case the doctor did an electrocauterization (office procedure) to treat it.  The first time he did it the treatment lasted 17 years for me.  (The doctor joked \"60 000 miles\").  When I had four bloody nose events in one week  I called and had the 2nd treatment done this spring.  Well worth it if you need it!  Are you coughing a lot?     It depends on what it looked like on how serious it is.     If it was bright red  or frothy and blood streaked  that's probably from a chest infection  and not that alarming  though you should see your doctor.     If it's dark red  or looks like coffee grounds  that's from the digestive tract  and could be very serious  and needs to be checked out right away - that warrants a trip to the hospital/emergency dept if it happens again  or at least an emergency call to your doctor.     It isn't from swallowing post-nasal drip  though.     Since your nose was bleeding  and you are coughing up stuff  I'd wonder if you have a sinus infection  or perhaps bronchitis. Of course  it's important to rule out COVID19. Give your doctor a call. Any time you cough up blood  it's worth at least a call to your doctor.     https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/321563    Let us know what happens  and feel better soon!    "

                " why do I have a constant dust or smoke smell in nasal passages I have noticed over the past 2 weeks that I have a constant dust or smoke smell in my nasal passages. No one smokes in my home and I have cleaned my house from top to bottom to rid it of any dust. I am just concerned that there might be some underlying problem. The smell can get quite bothersome at times.Please give me any suggestions.  Kindest Regards    Jackie BrienzaIv had a cold for over a week now and been to doc. Sinuses are infected and have a nasal drip which means mucus drips down the back of my throat from my sinuses and nose. The smell apparently is from my sinuses.  I was advised to sick on menthol cough sweets to help keep the sinuses and nostrils clear. Today is my first day and so far it&#39 s cleared a little.  Fingers crossed. I have the same problem as mentioned above. Mine is usually after I blow my nose  no matter the situation  I smell a dusty smell. I know when I'm in the shower and I blow my nose I am not smelling dust  and I work in a clean office and have a clean house with no animals so there isnt any way I'm actually smelling dust.  Its driving me crazy because I just had a bite of lunch and smelled the dust smell again.  Food is being ruined by this !  HELP  I am planning an appointment to a ENT specialist asap.  Perhaps I can shed some light soon for you all.  THanks  Craig T.   Erie  PAI suspected a fungal sinus infection so I flushed my nasal passages with a 1/16 solution of boric acid and distilled water yesterday afternoon. Smoke symptom disappeared and normal olifactory function restored. Nose is now working normally for the last 17 hours. Next time  I'll use a respirator when blowing leaves and mushrooms off my lawn.  --LenI am wondering the same thing.Seems to be worst when the electric furnace is on and heating. I've been recently diagnosed with COPD and heart failure whatever  I'm on a lot of medication and was thinking the medication may have something to do with it. Please help if you know of anything. The ENT doctor I saw twice doesn't help. don_nickleride***@****  ThanksI am surprised and relieved too to find so many people having the same problem as mine. I do not smoke myself but  last month when some friends came over to my house  they smoked. Though they had been in my house only for an evening  I cannot get rid of this smoke smell everywhere around myself. At first I thought something was burning or somebody smoking in the neighbourhood  but after I found nothing of the sort  I understood that this smoke and burning smell is only within my respiratory tract. Whats the solution? Its killing me!!I too have for the past month smell cigarette smoke all day and night  it's very annoying since I have never smoke and can't stand the smell and do everything possible to stay away from it. I continuely ask everyone around me if they smell cigarette smoke  they are annoyed that I keep asking. I work in a hospital setting so I know there is no smoking inside the building and co-workers around me do not smoke. HELP I HATE THE SMELL.Hello   Without examination it is very difficult to confirm a diagnosis  but the symptoms are suggestive of allergies to smoke or air borne allergies.Other possibilities may be recent sinusitis nasopharyngeal problems  olfactory hallucination {(phantosmia)you detect smells that are not really present in your environment} viral infections and disorders in the smell perception centres.    In my opinion a consultation of an ENT specialist or an allergist will be the best.    Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing and if you have any additional queries.    I occasionally have this issue of smelling dust or smoke regardless of where I am. Literally I can be in a wide variety of locations from my home (very clean)  to on an airplane  to driving in another state  to being in the wide open areas of a national park.      However I can induce the sensation by drinking water with MiO in it for a few days in a row.  So I'm thinking it's something being eaten that causes the sensation.  My guess is an artificial sweetener. MiO uses three: Ace-K  Sucralose  and Stevia that is supposed to be a \"natural sweetener\".  I am going buy a MiO with each identified separately and see if one or more in particular creates the sensation.    If I can remember how to get back to this page  I'll be happy to report my findings.I and my sister both have this sensation at times in our adult lives and we both figured it out independently  both coming to the same solution (we didn't know the other was experiencing until years later). For both of us it began when we were going through an incredibly stressful time in our adult lives. My sister would go as far as rewashing clothes that came directly out of the dryer even though nobody else could smell the smoke. We both determined that it is mental - when we get really stressed  we start \"smelling\" the smoke smell again. It's clear that it's all in our heads  so my theory is actually that it's not a smell  but rather a sensation that we are relating to the smell of smoke. I believe the sensation is caused by airways being restricted due to the stress (when you smell smoke you instinctively restrict air intake - so it's a similar 'sensation'). Now when I start smelling smoke  I focus on relaxing and the smell goes away. Hopefully this helps someone! I think it\u2019s s real particle that has a chemical on it that you inhaled into your nasal passages. Meanwhile  instead of lasting a day or 2 you may be constantly RE-exposing yourself to these particles by accident. A chemical bottle could be leaking in your basement or your attic at home or at work or across the street  etc. Consider relocating  air purifier  and a personal over-nose-mouth humidifier to wet particles down. Has anyone found a solution to this annoying constant smell of smoke and dust in the nose?  It has been going on for a couple of months now.I too have found that I constantly smell dust or smoke. Did anyone have a solution?This happened to me about 6 mths ago when a tupperware melted on my stove it lasted about a month. Now I just burnt a grilled cheese sandwich 2 days ago and it's going on again...mine must be smoke caught I my sinuses or nose hairs. I have had the exact same thing for the past  maybe  6 months.  I also have never smoked and work in a smoke free environment.  I started asking people at work if they smelled smoke  called the property manager  as I was suspicious that people were smoking on another floor (illegally)  and everyone humored me for awhile  then told me they didn't smell it.  I smell it at home  in the car  and off and on all day.  If I push my nose up  it goes away  so I am thinking it must have something to do with my own nose.   I just googled it  and found this site.  So  an ENT may be the right person to see?   I feel ridiculous  but this is sooo annoying!   "

                " Iv had a cold for over a week now and been to doc. Sinuses are infected and have a nasal drip which means mucus drips down the back of my throat from my sinuses and nose. The smell apparently is from my sinuses.  I was advised to sick on menthol cough sweets to help keep the sinuses and nostrils clear. Today is my first day and so far it&#39 s cleared a little.  Fingers crossed. ;I have the same problem as mentioned above. Mine is usually after I blow my nose  no matter the situation  I smell a dusty smell. I know when I'm in the shower and I blow my nose I am not smelling dust  and I work in a clean office and have a clean house with no animals so there isnt any way I'm actually smelling dust.  Its driving me crazy because I just had a bite of lunch and smelled the dust smell again.  Food is being ruined by this !  HELP  I am planning an appointment to a ENT specialist asap.  Perhaps I can shed some light soon for you all.  THanks  Craig T.   Erie  PA;I suspected a fungal sinus infection so I flushed my nasal passages with a 1/16 solution of boric acid and distilled water yesterday afternoon. Smoke symptom disappeared and normal olifactory function restored. Nose is now working normally for the last 17 hours. Next time  I'll use a respirator when blowing leaves and mushrooms off my lawn.  --Len;I am wondering the same thing.Seems to be worst when the electric furnace is on and heating. I've been recently diagnosed with COPD and heart failure whatever  I'm on a lot of medication and was thinking the medication may have something to do with it. Please help if you know of anything. The ENT doctor I saw twice doesn't help. don_nickleride***@****  Thanks;I am surprised and relieved too to find so many people having the same problem as mine.

No one smokes in my home and I have cleaned my house from top to bottom to rid it of any dust. I am just concerned that there might be some underlying problem. The smell can get quite bothersome at times.Please give me any suggestions.  Kindest Regards    Jackie Brienza"

                " RAD (Reactive Airway disease) Yesterday i got diagnosed with RAD.  I thought i was sick with sinus infection then a cold. Then it came down to me stop breathing multiple times and coughing horribly.  So i made a doctor's appointment and my doctor diagnosed me then just yesterday.  Im worried i wake up because i feel myself stop breathing and choking . Is this something  i have to worry about for my entire life im only 18years old. I need a little bit more information please help.How are you feeling now?  Has it settled down for you?  I had a very bad cold back in university and had a horrible cough for weeks and the initial RAD diagnosis was changed to asthma after some pulmonary function tests.  Keep using your inhalers and continue to work with your doctor until it stabilizes.  Feel better!Is this something that happens to you even when you aren't sick? I am on steroids and a inhaler.  No at work im not around chemicals at all. My doctor told me my lungs are not getting enough oxygen like they should be. She gave me a breathing treatment and tested how much Oxygen or air they can hold. And it wasn't good.   I can do the simplest thing and i catch myself out of breath or coughing. Rad is a term Drs. used to describe coughing and wheezing that could become asthma. Are you around and chemicles at work or anything at all. they can cause your breathing lessening. Are you on and meds for it?Ask your dr. for a relief inhaler when you get one of those spats of breathlessness it will help."
