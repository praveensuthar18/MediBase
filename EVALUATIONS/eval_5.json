                " Post gallbladder removal my 9 year old is having terrible nausea and pain My son had his gallbladder removed in January 2017 after 4 months of gallbladder attacks finally getting diagnosed with a HIDA scan of 0%.  He has done great for 8 months.  He had a couple of times of temporary stomach upset from fatty foods like ice cream.  He now wakes up every morning feeling like he needs to vomit running to the toilet.  He never vomits but coughs and welches like he is about to.  All tests come back negative.  We have done scope  ultrasound  MRCP  stomach emptying test  rounds of blood work.  We saw a different pediatric GI to see if he needs ERCP and he did not think he needs it.  His liver enzymes are normal and so are all the X-rays.    We have tried protonix  balcofen muscle relaxer  propranolol  Donnatal with no results.  We have also seen a neurologist and treated for abdominal migraines but no improvement.  He has these episodes where he gets flushed  ears get hot  BP and pulse are elevated to 130/88 and pulse can be 108.  Cardiologist said his heart is fine with an EKG and heart ultrasound.  These are the times where the stomach squeezing and nausea are worse.  It seems to be happening worse when his stomach is empty.    This last Pediatric GI is referring us to a functional abdominal pain clinic.  We have also tried doxycycline with no results.  I do not think it is IBS.  Also he has gained 18 pounds in the last 3 months which is very concerning especially on a 9 year old.  I am worried this will lead to diabetes.      Please help with any info since no doctors are helping."

                " Tingling - The path to recovery I'm beginning to have problems in opening the forum and also writing is very slow. What about starting the third chapter? Coriecl  give your contribution!Hi Robbo748     Nice to hear from you - but sorry you are having the same reaction that we have had to endure. It has been months for many of us. Thanks for your kind words  it has been in many ways the biggest physical challenge I have ever faced.    I can't believe your doctor would respond in that way - they have no idea how demoralizing it is to not be supported when we know for sure that the flu vacc caused our problems.    We are currently posting on  Chapter 2 Tingling after the swine flu  and don't really use this forum anymore.     Please join us there for support and friendship.    Cathywell  nice to find so many people with over active imaginations ( according to my doctor) as myself...ha ha..  once upon a time I could have been a male chauvinist pig  if that expression still exists?... after reading all these stories I have nothing but total admiration to everyone of you ladies (plus the few men!) for the hell and back journey many of you are yet to finish.... every one of you have \"unrelated\" symptoms according to my doctor... he refused to even look down when I placed printed evidence from this site right in front of him... surprise surprise?    so who am I? my name is Ronnie  and I live in Queensland Australia  48-year-old male  was very happy with my quiet little life  until skin cancer decided to pay me a visit that is. Whilst in my doctor's office having the lesion surgically removed  (local anaesthetic) he commented that he does not see me that often and I have never had a flu shot  and now the swine flu jab was free  being winter here  strongly coerced me into having it before I left.... I am spiteful and suspicious of the medical community as a whole  these sworn oath is \"cause no harm\"  yet they often seem to be very good at it.... please excuse the sarcasm  but a rheumatologist put me on a drug called Lyrica  which caused horrendous side-effects took nearly 2 years! to recover from! of course  as you all know  that was written off to a one in a million event  or I was making the whole thing up....  anyway  years later  I have had the same doctor for 21 years  he looked me in the eye and said \"tell me honestly how many people do you know  who've died from a flu shot?\" being a nonconfrontational kind of person  I relented  do I really  really have to say what happened next?  I received the swine flu jab in my left arm  then they wanted to give me the seasonal one in my right  however I refused  starting to become stressed that I even allowed them to give me swine flu one...these clinic people are great salespeople  stopped short of calling me a big girl!... to cut a ridiculously long story short  same as everybody  could not lift my left arm above my head day or so later  then nice improvement  but right on 10 days later  the fun really began..... if you have read this far  thank you  I have many things to say about this matter  some negative  but also some positive.. to be continued...hey folks     cup12 - yup  I have been dealing with the terrible headaches for almost 6 weeks...please try to take it easy. my doctor  was really specific about this when I went to see her a month ago - she was adamant. Alot of rest is needed to recoup and the headaches are so inflammatory - always bordering on migraines  that even regular activity can be overwhelming - you will get back to yourself. There is no rhyme or reason to the symptoms so pls don't be alarmed if anything comes back for a bit - these issues tend to come and go...also  these symptoms are written as side effects on the vacc leaflet - not sure why doc's are resistant to this - 1 in 10 000 will develop neuropathy. That's us! The tingle crew :)    reenie123: fill us in when you can (vacc date/medical opinion  etc)    I saw my doctor today: no problem re: her understanding of what happpened to me - she understands it as an auto immune neuropathic reaction to the flu shot. We discussed the philosophy of this shot and how the surrounding medical comunity is pro vacc even with folks who have auto immune illness and MS etc. They know that these reactions will occur  but feel it is better to have patients have the anti-bodies etc...    My opinion is not decided on this. Not sure what to think - as so many have been made so ill from the side effects. I will never be vaccinated for anything again. I began having muscle spasms in my cheek and jawline last night that woke me up...so painful...something new emerging at 6 weeks - seems hard to understand how this could go on for so long...I do know that 6 weeks post vacc and while no longer bed ridden and feeling much better  dealing with constant migraine-y/no appetite/sore eyes and eyeballs and now facial muscle spasms is getting tiresome. Enough already!    will write tomorrow     C.just got home from school.  feel absolutly horrible.  my head is pounding and im so nauseous.  maybe i over did it.  i wish i could go back to my old  energetic 23yr old self :(Reenie: let us know what your GP has to say and when you got the vaccination.i also have the migraine headaches now...daily! ughh exedrine helps. hopefully were getting to the end of all this....hey everyone! i am actually feeling much better today! the tingling has def gone almost completely away (hopefully im not jinxing myself).  i am left with a little prickling and some small muscle twitches but my body is def on the mend. my anxiety is way down...i only get worked up when i get my mind going! but i just keep saying TEMPORARY! u guys have def saved me sanity!! feeling a little more positive! no more flu shots for me!! :)    ps has anyone talked to their dr about any long term effects?? hope there aren't any! i'm relying on this forum for my info seeing as none of my drs will even consider this being a result of a flu shot  even tho i kno it is...i kno my own body! so glad i found you all! :)I am new here.  My hands are tingling like crazy --- I am so scared.... it feels like someone punched me in the right arm (not where I received my shot) --- I am calling my GP when he opens in 1/2 hour.  Please everyone - tell me I don't have gbs!!!!! I shouldnt have taken this stupid shot  but I have asthma - so I thought I was being wise --- biggest mistake in my life.  Hello newcomer :) While I am sorry you are here  I must tell you that you are in very good company with tons of new experts on this horrendous condition.    cup12  I had EVERY symptom you had exactly the way you explained  plus numerous other symptoms. I am 6 weeks post vacc and have been posting on Ch. 2/Path to Recov. I spent 2 days in hospital getting re-hydrated  and sick as hell  with a numb tingly body that felt like it was vibrating. Was bedridden for 5 days.My symptoms hit in the exactly the same way/exact same time as you... especially the headaches/upper back/ear pain. Same stomach issues  plus serious nausea...You are not alone - many folks on this site share the same symptoms - it is all vacc related and has been diagnosed by numerous doc's as an auto immune reaction that has affected the peripheral nerves:look up neuropathy. Also  I needed sedatives to calm a constant anxiety like feeling - it is normal to have high anxiety around this illness - your nervous system is also more sensitive...      I suggest you read all the posts from the very beginning (all three chapters) you will find them informative  comforting  helpful and a solid tool for your recovery. Lots of great suggestions  dialogue  recommendations and support when we hot rock bottom (we are all in agreement that this affliction has tested our metal in ways we didn't know could be tested)    It does get a bit confusing as we are posting between Ch.2 and Path to recovery  so just go back and check them all out - you will find it very helpful.    Let us know how you are doing - the vitamins/juices/diet suggestions were super helpful.     The best medicine by far is the people - they literally saved me and my sanity.    Take care - write back     Cathy  There you go...the neuro said not to worry and it will go away!     I didn't have that problem...both my neuro and doctor agree that it's from the vaccine. Good to know! No I didn't have an emg bc all other tests were normal. He said I should not worry and is confident it will go away in time  however he does not think it was from the flu shot. gen49: Got it! thanks.  cup12: Yes  definitely temporary! or else something would have shown up on all those tests you had. My doc explained that it was an over-reaction of the immune system (to what in the vaccine we're unsure of) and it attacked the sensory nerve system  thankfully not the central nervous system. The sensory nerve system can repair/heal itself. But it does take time. I looked at the list of tests you had but it didn't say anything about a nerve conduction or an EMG test. Did you have one or both of those? If not  I would ask your neurologist if it should be considered. Is everybody pretty confident that this is only temporary?? I'm worried. PCP - Primary Care PhysicianFrancy and I have both recommended sedatives to sleep through the night. It definitely helped us both  it's hard for your body to repair itself if it doesn't get enough rest.    I would definitely recommend Vitamin b12 sublingual tablet  as well as  a Vitamin B complex. My Jan 15th posting: I wrote down what my naturopathic doctor recommended to me. If you decide to do the same regime take the PM doses with dinner or else it might energize you too much to sleep. The nutrients brought my energy and mood up.     On Tingling - Chapter Two  I explain how a friend of mine had the same symptoms as us but the one neurologist she saw said she had a \"virus\". She tingled off and on for 10 months but it eventually went away. This was 5 years ago so don't give up hope thinking that this is permanent. It just means you need to take optimum care of yourself and seek out therapies or ways to help yourself heal. Some people are seeing acupuncturists  chiropractors  or massage therapists  others are practicing relaxation or yoga  some are seeing holistic/naturopath doctors  most are taking nutritional supplements and eating healthy diets.     Other people have mentioned bubbles or hot-spots under the skin. My friend had the same thing too. I've read that it's nerves repairing itself...which is a good thing!!! I had digestion problems in the beginning but I did force myself to eat fruit  vegetables and soup and my appetite did come back. I also read that Cathy does juicing.     I keep reading about PCPs. Can you tell me what that is? I'm assuming it's a medical doctor but I'm not familiar with the acronym. So I just got back from my PCP. A complete waste of time! She just sat there and stared at me as I bawled my eyes out and told me she has never heard of such a thing. I even printed out some posts from this forum to show her to prove that others were experiencing the same thing. She told me there was nothing she could do and to go back to the neurologist and she would refund me my 20$ copay...how thoughtful.  I went to the health store and got a cal/mag supplement along with a gentle detox...hope it helps!!This is the perfect venue to vent all of your feelings and frustrations because we have all been there.  Finding this forum helped me a lot.  Any time you post a message  know that someone is listening who has experienced the same or similar things. If you take time to read all of the posts  you will find it informative even though we are all different. I had to look for a new PCP as well.  The one who highly recommended I get the shot in the first place denied it was the vaccine and left the scene.cup12: I had the shot on Oct. 26th and still having twitching and tingling. It has got alot better though. Just hang in there because people have been on here for awhile and alot are completely recovered it just takes awhile. And remember everyone is different I am sure size and immune system all plays a part in this. Just to let you know there is another discussion called tingling swine flu vaccine chapter 2. If you click on my name you can click on chap. 2 and it will take you there. It has more people about where you are at with this point of the reaction. One thing that I always try to remember is the word TEMPORARY! Because this reaction is temporary. That is proven with all the people that have gotten over it. Take care  JulieThx francy. I think it may be taking me longer bc I can't seem to shake this worry/stress when I feel these symptoms.  I am going back to ny dr today. Did anyone have stomach or indigestion problems? I have NO appetite and feel like my stomach is going nuts its so loud. This could be a result of stress too  I don't know. I also have the feeling of bubbles popping under my skin now too. Great way to describe it.  I had the shot on Nov. the 9th....and yes  I'd dare say I am completely symptom-free...  Dear cup12  we all believe you and be certain that you will go back to your earlier self! This thing passes  sooner or later (different times for different peoples)  but it goes away! Stay calm and never lose your your hope  you can see my case and also others.  A big hug  FrancescaHi everyone  I am new to this forum. So glad I found it. You are all making me feel a little better. I too had the swine vaccine in early nov. That same night I had what I thought was a panic attack but now know I was having a reaction to the shot. About 3 days later I started tingling in my legs and it was all down hill from there. I have been to my PCP who refuses to believe this all has anything to do with the shot (I'm in the process of finding another one) and does nothing to help me. I have also been to a neurologist. I've had mris  ct scans  blood work  chest xrays  ekgs...all normal. I have started seeing a psychatrist bc my anxiety and panic over all this has almost drove me insane.I'm afraid I'm going to die.  Seeing that I was against the shot to begin with I'm really beating myself up about getting it.  My worst fear has now become a reality. I can say that the first couple weeks were the worst! I have never been through anything so awful in my life! The tingling is still there but has improved. I actually sleep through the night now (that is when I'm not worrying myself to death). I'm still twitching everywhere. I have also been getting these terrible migraine like headaches with the worst shoulder and neck pain and I feel like both my ears are aching. I also had that weird throat feeling and extreme dry mouth which has gone away. I'm sorry this is so long but I'm really at my wits end with this. I'm also a full time nursing student in my lasts semester. Trying really hard to not let this ruin everything I've worked so hard for. I just need some reassurance and hope that I will be my old self again one day. I've become so depressed and scared. I feel like I've driven my bf and fam crazy with my complaining and no one believes me. I'm only 23 and was perfectly healthy before all this. :(How wonderful to hear you are doing so much better. Are you completely syptom free? Can you please refresh my memory as to when you were vaccinated? This is so encouraging! Thanks  JullieFrancy: great to hear! and that you are singing! I am going to leave you a private message so that you can contact me if you ever would like to OR if you ever come to Vancouver  Canada ... you're probably not coming here for the winter Olympics next month I imagine?!!!  Live Live Live Well  Dear Lady!  All the best :)...you just call out my name  and you know  wherever I am  I'll come running  to see you again....Great! I even sing James Taylor now! My dear friend  I've been very busy LIVING  that's why I haven't written for so long! I see that everyone here is pretty fine  more or less  and so the name I chose for the forum is really a good one! I'm happy to say that all this tingling stuff is becoming slowly a memory for me....DON'T get vaccinated: all this advertising and pushing to get the shot is because countries have SOOOO MANY doses left behind and they don't know what to do with them! Heaps of money wasted and sqandered. They are criminals....  Please  take care and stay well  I hug you all! Bye   Francy."

Cathy;well  nice to find so many people with over active imaginations ( according to my doctor) as myself...ha ha..  once upon a time I could have been a male chauvinist pig  if that expression still exists?... after reading all these stories I have nothing but total admiration to everyone of you ladies (plus the few men!) for the hell and back journey many of you are yet to finish.... every one of you have \"unrelated\" symptoms according to my doctor... he refused to even look down when I placed printed evidence from this site right in front of him... surprise surprise?    so who am I? my name is Ronnie  and I live in Queensland Australia  48-year-old male  was very happy with my quiet little life  until skin cancer decided to pay me a visit that is. Whilst in my doctor's office having the lesion surgically removed  (local anaesthetic) he commented that he does not see me that often and I have never had a flu shot  and now the swine flu jab was free  being winter here  strongly coerced me into having it before I left.... I am spiteful and suspicious of the medical community as a whole  these sworn oath is \"cause no harm\"  yet they often seem to be very good at it.... please excuse the sarcasm  but a rheumatologist put me on a drug called Lyrica  which caused horrendous side-effects took nearly 2 years! to recover from! of course  as you all know  that was written off to a one in a million event  or I was making the whole thing up....  anyway  years later  I have had the same doctor for 21 years  he looked me in the eye and said \"tell me honestly how many people do you know  who've died from a flu shot?\" being a nonconfrontational kind of person  I relented  do I really  really have to say what happened next?  I received the swine flu jab in my left arm  then they wanted to give me the seasonal one in my right  however I refused  starting to become stressed that I even allowed them to give me swine flu one...these clinic people are great salespeople  stopped short of calling me a big girl!... to cut a ridiculously long story short  same as everybody  could not lift my left arm above my head day or so later  then nice improvement  but right on 10 days later  the fun really began..... if you have read this far  thank you  I have many things to say about this matter  some negative  but also some positive.. to be continued...;hey folks     cup12 - yup  I have been dealing with the terrible headaches for almost 6 weeks...please try to take it easy. my doctor  was really specific about this when I went to see her a month ago - she was adamant. Alot of rest is needed to recoup and the headaches are so inflammatory - always bordering on migraines  that even regular activity can be overwhelming - you will get back to yourself. There is no rhyme or reason to the symptoms so pls don't be alarmed if anything comes back for a bit - these issues tend to come and go...also  these symptoms are written as side effects on the vacc leaflet - not sure why doc's are resistant to this - 1 in 10 000 will develop neuropathy. That's us! The tingle crew :)    reenie123: fill us in when you can (vacc date/medical opinion  etc)    I saw my doctor today: no problem re: her understanding of what happpened to me - she understands it as an auto immune neuropathic reaction to the flu shot. We discussed the philosophy of this shot and how the surrounding medical comunity is pro vacc even with folks who have auto immune illness and MS etc. They know that these reactions will occur  but feel it is better to have patients have the anti-bodies etc...    My opinion is not decided on this. Not sure what to think - as so many have been made so ill from the side effects. I will never be vaccinated for anything again. I began having muscle spasms in my cheek and jawline last night that woke me up...so painful...something new emerging at 6 weeks - seems hard to understand how this could go on for so long...I do know that 6 weeks post vacc and while no longer bed ridden and feeling much better  dealing with constant migraine-y/no appetite/sore eyes and eyeballs and now facial muscle spasms is getting tiresome. Enough already!    will write tomorrow     C.;just got home from school.  feel absolutly horrible.  my head is pounding and im so nauseous.  maybe i over did it.  i wish i could go back to my old  energetic 23yr old self :(;Reenie: let us know what your GP has to say and when you got the vaccination.;i also have the migraine headaches now...daily! ughh exedrine helps. hopefully were getting to the end of all this....;hey everyone! i am actually feeling much better today! the tingling has def gone almost completely away (hopefully im not jinxing myself).  i am left with a little prickling and some small muscle twitches but my body is def on the mend. my anxiety is way down...i only get worked up when i get my mind going! but i just keep saying TEMPORARY! u guys have def saved me sanity!! feeling a little more positive! no more flu shots for me!! :)    ps has anyone talked to their dr about any long term effects?? hope there aren't any! i'm relying on this forum for my info seeing as none of my drs will even consider this being a result of a flu shot  even tho i kno it is...i kno my own body! so glad i found you all! :);I am new here.  My hands are tingling like crazy --- I am so scared.... it feels like someone punched me in the right arm (not where I received my shot) --- I am calling my GP when he opens in 1/2 hour.  Please everyone - tell me I don't have gbs!!!!! I shouldnt have taken this stupid shot  but I have asthma - so I thought I was being wise --- biggest mistake in my life.;  Hello newcomer :) While I am sorry you are here  I must tell you that you are in very good company with tons of new experts on this horrendous condition.    cup12  I had EVERY symptom you had exactly the way you explained  plus numerous other symptoms. I am 6 weeks post vacc and have been posting on Ch. 2/Path to Recov. I spent 2 days in hospital getting re-hydrated  and sick as hell  with a numb tingly body that felt like it was vibrating. Was bedridden for 5 days.My symptoms hit in the exactly the same way/exact same time as you... especially the headaches/upper back/ear pain. Same stomach issues  plus serious nausea...You are not alone - many folks on this site share the same symptoms - it is all vacc related and has been diagnosed by numerous doc's as an auto immune reaction that has affected the peripheral nerves:look up neuropathy. Also  I needed sedatives to calm a constant anxiety like feeling - it is normal to have high anxiety around this illness - your nervous system is also more sensitive...      I suggest you read all the posts from the very beginning (all three chapters) you will find them informative  comforting  helpful and a solid tool for your recovery. Lots of great suggestions  dialogue  recommendations and support when we hot rock bottom (we are all in agreement that this affliction has tested our metal in ways we didn't know could be tested)    It does get a bit confusing as we are posting between Ch.2 and Path to recovery  so just go back and check them all out - you will find it very helpful.    Let us know how you are doing - the vitamins/juices/diet suggestions were super helpful.     The best medicine by far is the people - they literally saved me and my sanity.    Take care - write back     Cathy  ;There you go...the neuro said not to worry and it will go away!     I didn't have that problem...both my neuro and doctor agree that it's from the vaccine. ;Good to know! No I didn't have an emg bc all other tests were normal. He said I should not worry and is confident it will go away in time  however he does not think it was from the flu shot. ;gen49: Got it! thanks.  cup12: Yes  definitely temporary! or else something would have shown up on all those tests you had. My doc explained that it was an over-reaction of the immune system (to what in the vaccine we're unsure of) and it attacked the sensory nerve system  thankfully not the central nervous system. The sensory nerve system can repair/heal itself. But it does take time. I looked at the list of tests you had but it didn't say anything about a nerve conduction or an EMG test. Did you have one or both of those? If not  I would ask your neurologist if it should be considered. ;Is everybody pretty confident that this is only temporary?? I'm worried. ;PCP - Primary Care Physician;Francy and I have both recommended sedatives to sleep through the night. It definitely helped us both  it's hard for your body to repair itself if it doesn't get enough rest.    I would definitely recommend Vitamin b12 sublingual tablet  as well as  a Vitamin B complex. My Jan 15th posting: I wrote down what my naturopathic doctor recommended to me. If you decide to do the same regime take the PM doses with dinner or else it might energize you too much to sleep. The nutrients brought my energy and mood up.     On Tingling - Chapter Two  I explain how a friend of mine had the same symptoms as us but the one neurologist she saw said she had a \"virus\". She tingled off and on for 10 months but it eventually went away. This was 5 years ago so don't give up hope thinking that this is permanent. It just means you need to take optimum care of yourself and seek out therapies or ways to help yourself heal. Some people are seeing acupuncturists  chiropractors  or massage therapists  others are practicing relaxation or yoga  some are seeing holistic/naturopath doctors  most are taking nutritional supplements and eating healthy diets.     Other people have mentioned bubbles or hot-spots under the skin. My friend had the same thing too. I've read that it's nerves repairing itself...which is a good thing!!! I had digestion problems in the beginning but I did force myself to eat fruit  vegetables and soup and my appetite did come back. I also read that Cathy does juicing.     I keep reading about PCPs. Can you tell me what that is? I'm assuming it's a medical doctor but I'm not familiar with the acronym. ;So I just got back from my PCP. A complete waste of time! She just sat there and stared at me as I bawled my eyes out and told me she has never heard of such a thing. I even printed out some posts from this forum to show her to prove that others were experiencing the same thing. She told me there was nothing she could do and to go back to the neurologist and she would refund me my 20$ copay...how thoughtful.  I went to the health store and got a cal/mag supplement along with a gentle detox...hope it helps!!;This is the perfect venue to vent all of your feelings and frustrations because we have all been there.  Finding this forum helped me a lot.  Any time you post a message  know that someone is listening who has experienced the same or similar things. If you take time to read all of the posts  you will find it informative even though we are all different. I had to look for a new PCP as well.  The one who highly recommended I get the shot in the first place denied it was the vaccine and left the scene.;cup12: I had the shot on Oct. 26th and still having twitching and tingling. It has got alot better though. Just hang in there because people have been on here for awhile and alot are completely recovered it just takes awhile. And remember everyone is different I am sure size and immune system all plays a part in this. Just to let you know there is another discussion called tingling swine flu vaccine chapter 2. If you click on my name you can click on chap. 2 and it will take you there. It has more people about where you are at with this point of the reaction. One thing that I always try to remember is the word TEMPORARY! Because this reaction is temporary. That is proven with all the people that have gotten over it. Take care  Julie;Thx francy. I think it may be taking me longer bc I can't seem to shake this worry/stress when I feel these symptoms.  I am going back to ny dr today. Did anyone have stomach or indigestion problems? I have NO appetite and feel like my stomach is going nuts its so loud. This could be a result of stress too  I don't know. I also have the feeling of bubbles popping under my skin now too. Great way to describe it.  ;I had the shot on Nov. the 9th....and yes  I'd dare say I am completely symptom-free...  Dear cup12  we all believe you and be certain that you will go back to your earlier self! This thing passes  sooner or later (different times for different peoples)  but it goes away! Stay calm and never lose your your hope  you can see my case and also others.  A big hug  Francesca;Hi everyone  I am new to this forum. So glad I found it. You are all making me feel a little better. I too had the swine vaccine in early nov. That same night I had what I thought was a panic attack but now know I was having a reaction to the shot. About 3 days later I started tingling in my legs and it was all down hill from there. I have been to my PCP who refuses to believe this all has anything to do with the shot (I'm in the process of finding another one) and does nothing to help me. I have also been to a neurologist. I've had mris  ct scans  blood work  chest xrays  ekgs...all normal. I have started seeing a psychatrist bc my anxiety and panic over all this has almost drove me insane.I'm afraid I'm going to die.  Seeing that I was against the shot to begin with I'm really beating myself up about getting it.  My worst fear has now become a reality. I can say that the first couple weeks were the worst! I have never been through anything so awful in my life! The tingling is still there but has improved. I actually sleep through the night now (that is when I'm not worrying myself to death). I'm still twitching everywhere. I have also been getting these terrible migraine like headaches with the worst shoulder and neck pain and I feel like both my ears are aching. I also had that weird throat feeling and extreme dry mouth which has gone away. I'm sorry this is so long but I'm really at my wits end with this. I'm also a full time nursing student in my lasts semester. Trying really hard to not let this ruin everything I've worked so hard for. I just need some reassurance and hope that I will be my old self again one day. I've become so depressed and scared. I feel like I've driven my bf and fam crazy with my complaining and no one believes me. I'm only 23 and was perfectly healthy before all this. :(;How wonderful to hear you are doing so much better. Are you completely syptom free? Can you please refresh my memory as to when you were vaccinated? This is so encouraging! Thanks  Jullie;Francy: great to hear! and that you are singing! I am going to leave you a private message so that you can contact me if you ever would like to OR if you ever come to Vancouver  Canada ... you're probably not coming here for the winter Olympics next month I imagine?!!!  Live Live Live Well  Dear Lady!  All the best :);...you just call out my name  and you know  wherever I am  I'll come running  to see you again....Great! I even sing James Taylor now! My dear friend  I've been very busy LIVING  that's why I haven't written for so long! I see that everyone here is pretty fine  more or less  and so the name I chose for the forum is really a good one! I'm happy to say that all this tingling stuff is becoming slowly a memory for me....DON'T get vaccinated: all this advertising and pushing to get the shot is because countries have SOOOO MANY doses left behind and they don't know what to do with them! Heaps of money wasted and sqandered. They are criminals....  Please  take care and stay well  I hug you all! Bye   Francy."

                " Bloating Doesn't Go Away I have been diagnosed with IBS.  I have severe bloating and occasional bouts of constipation.

                " Esophageal Spasm I was just diagnosed with esophageal spasm.  I have terrible chest and back pain that comes pretty close to the open-heart surgery I've had in the past.  It came on really quickly and the doctor has me on Prilosec and antacids after meals and at bedtime  and she just added viscous lidocaine solution to numb the esophagus.  I'm eating a low acidic diet and combining my foods properly.  Has anyone out there had this terrible thing and if so  any other suggestions?I had Gerd so badly that prilosec did nothing.

It came on really quickly and the doctor has me on Prilosec and antacids after meals and at bedtime  and she just added viscous lidocaine solution to numb the esophagus.

You should also see a doctor if you continue to have blood in your stools. Maybe the garlic is causing it as it is kind of rough for some folks to digest  but  whatever the reason  blood in the stools need to be checked as soon as possible.Do you have that reaction to ANYTHING else?

I am by know means knowledgeable about food allergies  but I do know garlic is high in sulphur  and that allergies to sulphur can be very severe.    Look up \"sulphur allergy symptoms\"  and be sure not to confuse it with sulphA wich is far more common and NOT the same thing. Some are allergic to both  but if I remember correctly  that's not very common.    I'm going by a friend who had an allergy to sulphur - it sent her to the ER several times before they caught it because foods containing sulphur vary far more than say  dairy or peanuts. Ie  I think sour cream is also on the sulphur no-no list.    Good luck & be careful what you eat until it's identified (my friends was misdiagnosed as food poisoning on at least 2 occasions  and having no clue of the culprit  kept eating sulphur. Most often she'd get headaches & stomach aches that she never connected to food  but if she ate a LOT of it  she was severely ill with symptoms much like yours)    Hope this helps.Thank youYes  I agree with above poster .. also  you should see a doctor anytime you have blood in your stools.

                " Does anyone else have severe tremors  body twitches  and high blood pressure with their POTS? Hi          I just came back from Cleveland Clinic and I tested positive on the tilt table for POTS  but they also told me that it is secondary to a primary problem.  They told me that POTS doesn't have severe tremors  body twithces  and high blood pressure.  My tremors are so severe at times that I look like I am having a seizure  but I'm not.  I get body twitches that I can not control.  My hand might just fly up in the air  sometimes it's a leg  or finger  and I've even had my entire body twitch so hard that it hurts.  If anyone else has these symptoms  please let me know and do you have a diagnosis?  Are there any meds or things out there to help with the tremors and body twitches.  They are making me very weak.  I have even fallen because my legs are shaking so bad  that they won't support me.  Thanks for any help or ideas you can give him.Is it possible you have tardive dyskinesia? My POTS/Dysautonomia is related to an old medication reaction that basically crashed my autonomic nervous system. (Tardive Dyskinesia)-I have involuntary muscle spasms in both legs  both arms & my scalp. It took years to realize the spasms were from an old drug reaction. It was additional years before it was discovered I have really low dopamine levels. That specific med requires lots of dopamine. It lead to the realization all my dysautonomia symptoms related back to this one medication reaction. I also looked like I was having seizures. My tardive dyskinesia was controlled with baclofen (muscle relaxant)  valium  & diphenhydramine (benadryl). The baclofen & valium were oral meds  the benadryl was IV. Over time I have been able to slowly wean off the baclofen & valium. I mean VERY slowly. I am trying to very slowly lower my benadryl. On a tilt table test I also have swings in my heart rate & blood pressure even if I just speak. An interesting thing is when distracted the symptoms of tardive dyskinesia actually get WORSE. Why this is important to know is a medical provider can misinterpret if your symptoms get worse when with you vs them observing you without you knowing they are there. They can think you are purposely making symptoms worse when they are there.  In reality  when distracted you are LESS able to control symptoms on your own. Hope this helps in some way.I do experience shaking and tremors but I always assumed it was caused by my anxiety. I do experience shaking and tremors but I always assumed it was caused by my anxiety. I have not been tested for POTS but will be soon I've been having very many issues with my so called \"syncope\"  BUT yes  I just passed out recently on Sunday and seem to have seized after. It was super scary and it happens almost everytime. My doctor didn't believe me at first  but now does after witnesses telling him what happens to me after I pass out. He believes they are non-epileptic seizures. Could that be a possibility for you as well?Hello Rhonda    I'm reading your post many years after you wrote it  and it is exactly the symptoms my wife has now    She is diagnosed with autonomic dysfunction  ehlers danlos and pots. Currently she is on midrodine  and they are considering evabrodine also.    Love to hear how you've been and your experiences since this post.Hi Rhonda I know you left this post such a long time ago but  I have just now come across it......I also have POTS and all of the symptoms you mentioned above plus many many more. Have you ever heard of dysautonomia it actually goes along with POTS you should look it up and all of your symptoms would make so much more since to you.  I am sorry you also have to go through this and I pray you can get in under control one day. I have been going through these symptoms for 6 years now and it took 3 years to find a doctor who could figure out what was going on. I am still getting new symptoms every now and then so it is very frustrating..... you may already know this but if now drink 3-4 liters of water a day and add lots of salt to your diet. My blood pressure drops so low I sometimes have to actually lick a handful of salt. It also helps me when I get IV fluids every now and then. I hope you have found something that helps you in some way  this is a very difficult thing to live with.    Danelle   I was diagnosed with Orthostatic Tremors and Propriosponal Myoclonus.  I have very similar symptoms  along with blood pressure that spikes and then often goes very low.  I am taking Carvedilol and Avapro for blood pressure and Clonazepam and Keppra for the neurological conditions.  I couldn't function without these meds  but still have episodes out if the blue.  Then I need to rest for several days to regain my strength.I have severe tachycardia upon awakening sometime middle of night followed by entire body  tremors that lasts 20-3 0 min not sure since checking time is the last thing on my mind during episodes. I am diagnosed with pots. Just started on atenolol 1/4 of 25 mg which seems to eliminate day time tachycardia. This morning episode was not expected though. Took atenolol which stopped tachycardia but not tremors. Want to try propranolol  which is systemic beta blocker vs.atenolol is a cardio beta blocker. My sister bought it for me in ukraine. They sell pretty much everything without a prescription. Dr. Svetlana Blitshteyn from NY recomended atenolol after I had a telephone consult with her. I was hoping to ride out POTS without medication. Darn it.    Rhonda  except for the \"high\" blood pressure  your symptoms are the same as my daughter's. She has extremely low blood pressure. She has been fainting because of it since she was 17.Personally  I would wait until the Mayo Clinic appointment. We're probably going to be taking our 20-year-old daughter to the Mayo Clinic in December. They will have several specialists on your team to evaluate you. Don't lose hope.My daughter was also recently diagnosed with POTS. Her cardiologist told us that the tremors are not related... NOT buying it! I have also seen videos and read many posts from others who have POTS and tremors. Don't understand how doctors can keep telling us that the tremors aren't related to POTS! My daughter is only 20 and has her whole life ahead of her... every day is such a struggle for her. She faints almost everyday  and sometimes several times a day. Midodrine and salt tablets aren't working to keep her blood pressure up enough to prevent it from bottoming out and making her faint. My daughter has POTS and she does the same thing. All of the Dr. tell us that it is not the POTS. It is not seizures. I have seen many people posting things like this. It is not in your head. The Dr.s have not gotten this disease figured out. There are many videos on youtube. Have strength and hang in there. Just know that it is not you  and you are not making it up.Yes  I have been diagnosed with POTS and also have severe tremors that shake my entire body  especially from the stomach area out to the rest of my body. It can last for hours  and my blood pressure is not low during this. A clonidine transdermal patch and clonazepam help significantly. The problem with Clonazepam  though  is that it will stop working  so you have to take a small dose and taper off it when you don't need it so that it will work when you have another \"seizure\" episode. I  too  am trying to find out what can better help. Sleeping well and avoiding lots of sensory stimulation (I wear earplugs a lot) helps. I hope and pray that the medical community comes up with a good answer  but I have also received significant help from healing prayer teams such as the one at ibethel.org. You can Skype with them on Saturdays and Thursdays  and they will pray for you.

Were still trying to figure it out I have them every four months an last summer lost my memory for 2 months. Anytime I have one I lose speech  being able to see or walkCan both of you start new threads with your topics?  (Click the \"Post a Question\" button near the top of this page to do so.)  I'm afraid your posts are buried at the bottom of this outdated thread (from the summer of 08) and are not going to get the attention they deserve in our forum.      Looking forward to getting to know you both better   Heiferly.ummm  i've read some of your comments and symptoms and I have to admit that I too have experienced this as well. After a good workout or cracking my knuckles  my thumb or middle finger will twitch like crazy. I also get this twitching feeling in my legs near my knees and in the bicep part of my arm. I recently went to a physician and was told that I have high blood pressure as well. My B/P is only 156/108 but still its abnormally high for someone my age. I haven't been to a doctor yet  so i'm wondering should I go and check this out. Please comments and concerns are welcome. Wow! I've been searching and searching for answers or clues to what I've been experiancing.I  have all the symtoms that rhonda talks about. I have a doctor appointment on  Thursday hoping my doctor can help me in these areas.I have first noticed these issues back in 2006 but they went away for about 2 1/2 years.Now they are back stronger than ever and I'm afraid to drive.It hurts and after the tremors or seizure like symptoms and certain parts of my body feels like it's on fire. I feel trapped in my own body but thanks for the info it was very insightfulWhen I first started with dysautonomia I sounded just like you  I had involuntary twitches and tremors and all the things you have that was nine months ago I was tested for everything they were so sure I had a pheochromocytoma that I was sent to NIH and tested negitive. Had very bad head tremors still have them sometimes  I was unable to walk without holding on too something and then only to bed and bathroom I thought I was going to die. I tested positive for pots too  they also thought I had to have something else besides pots  well I have been to Vanderbilt and all over the place and not one MD could tell me what I had they never thought I had MSA though. I was very weak and could not eat I lost 40 lbs and though I was going to die. I had all your symptoms and more. Slowly they have gotten better what I feel really helped me was a clonodine patch .1mg per day I can tell you when I get off of it like I had too for Vanderbilt recently it was hell. What finally made sense too me was my sympathic nervous system for some reason went haywire and they just don't know. I can tell you I am better it took me until Jan and I had been sick since May of last year  I still have a lot of issues but not like I did before I still have high heart rates at times but usually not over 110's even when I am walking. I still have tremors but not as bad as before  I still get some mini inadvertant movements but none like it was so keep you chin up I really thing you need to get on the right meds now my BP hardly ever gets above 120's over 80 unless I am having a very bad day   I drink a lot and the big difference was once I had control over my BP and heart rates I also take atenlol 12.5mg every day. I could function again so don't let them scare you it could be pots the hyperadnergic type and with the proper meds and exercise you will improve  I felt like my life was over and at times now I doo also but I keep pluggin along and everyday I see a little improvement. If you need to e mail me privately give me you e mail . Sounds a lot like a pheochromocytomaHi          Thanks for all of the information.  I have been gone for the past 9 days and haven't been able to check my email.        Ryan  I did have a 24 hr. urine test done at Cleveland Clinic and they did a Cat Scan of my abdomen to see if my adrenal gland had a tumor and it wasn't present.  I received all of my information from MAYO and they will be doing the other tests that you mentioned out there again.  I have many other tests they plan on administering  too.  My doctor just had to up my medication again as my average blood pressure during the day was 168/115 and my heart rate was 169.  I really hope they can find something to control the B/P  because if they can't it is going to damage my heart.  So  far I have been lucky and my heart is still okay  but the doctors told me that it can't withstand those numbers indefinetly.  This is the 4th time since March that they have had to double my medication.  My body seems to ignore the medication after about 3 weeks and everything starts going back up again.      Plateletgirl thanks for the information about the Marshall Protocol.  I will be looking into more information about this.  Please send me any information that you have and I will google it.  I have found that you have to be an advocate for yourself and proactive in your medical issues.  Some doctors just don't understand or think you are having anxiety attacks.  But  anxiety attacks don't happen 24/7.      I would appreciate your prayers within the next month.  I am to be weened off ALL of my medications by October 4th for my tests scheduled at MAYO.  I all ready have a difficult time and I can't imagine how things are going to be with no meds.  I look like someone having a seizure at times with the meds.  So  needless to say I am nervous about being off all meds.    Thanks for everything   Rhonda  What Dr. Marshall also says is that the Benicar allows your immune system to 'see' and eliminate intracellular bacteria. He believes that intraceullular bacteria is the underlying cause of many illnesses.    I know if my physician had me on the Benicar and then gave me a FULL dose of Minocycline... that I would be in trouble. I had to slowly add the Minocycline to the mix and started taking only 25 MG every 48 hours. It was amazing what a small dose of minocycline along with the Benicar could do. I had herxing symptoms and felt worse as a result.    The Marshall Protocol is a research protocol. You can google for more information.  \"Benicar  when given to healthy people  causes a very mild depression in blood pressure (the FDA has told us that it is the least effective of all the pressor drugs) and no side effects beyond dizziness. But when given to sick people  as we have found  it has a profound effect  due to the immunopathology.\"    ~Dr. Trevor Marshall  Ph.D.  \"I was started on 20 milligrams of Benicar  which was increased to 40 milligrams after two weeks. At the time  I also had an infection  and was taking Minocycline.\"    Hi Ryan     Thank you for your comments. I find everything you've said very interesting. I was on the  Marshall Protocol for CFS. I started out with Benicar (40 MG 3 X daily) and eventually added Minocycline to the mix. I'm wondering if your symptoms were due to severe herxing (AKA: Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction) ???"

                " Is it possible you have tardive dyskinesia? My POTS/Dysautonomia is related to an old medication reaction that basically crashed my autonomic nervous system. (Tardive Dyskinesia)-I have involuntary muscle spasms in both legs  both arms & my scalp. It took years to realize the spasms were from an old drug reaction. It was additional years before it was discovered I have really low dopamine levels. That specific med requires lots of dopamine. It lead to the realization all my dysautonomia symptoms related back to this one medication reaction. I also looked like I was having seizures. My tardive dyskinesia was controlled with baclofen (muscle relaxant)  valium  & diphenhydramine (benadryl). The baclofen & valium were oral meds  the benadryl was IV. Over time I have been able to slowly wean off the baclofen & valium. I mean VERY slowly. I am trying to very slowly lower my benadryl. On a tilt table test I also have swings in my heart rate & blood pressure even if I just speak. An interesting thing is when distracted the symptoms of tardive dyskinesia actually get WORSE. Why this is important to know is a medical provider can misinterpret if your symptoms get worse when with you vs them observing you without you knowing they are there. They can think you are purposely making symptoms worse when they are there.  In reality  when distracted you are LESS able to control symptoms on your own. Hope this helps in some way.;I do experience shaking and tremors but I always assumed it was caused by my anxiety. ;I do experience shaking and tremors but I always assumed it was caused by my anxiety. ;I have not been tested for POTS but will be soon I've been having very many issues with my so called \"syncope\"  BUT yes  I just passed out recently on Sunday and seem to have seized after. It was super scary and it happens almost everytime. My doctor didn't believe me at first  but now does after witnesses telling him what happens to me after I pass out. He believes they are non-epileptic seizures. Could that be a possibility for you as well?;Hello Rhonda    I'm reading your post many years after you wrote it  and it is exactly the symptoms my wife has now    She is diagnosed with autonomic dysfunction  ehlers danlos and pots. Currently she is on midrodine  and they are considering evabrodine also.    Love to hear how you've been and your experiences since this post.;Hi Rhonda I know you left this post such a long time ago but  I have just now come across it......I also have POTS and all of the symptoms you mentioned above plus many many more. Have you ever heard of dysautonomia it actually goes along with POTS you should look it up and all of your symptoms would make so much more since to you.  I am sorry you also have to go through this and I pray you can get in under control one day. I have been going through these symptoms for 6 years now and it took 3 years to find a doctor who could figure out what was going on. I am still getting new symptoms every now and then so it is very frustrating..... you may already know this but if now drink 3-4 liters of water a day and add lots of salt to your diet. My blood pressure drops so low I sometimes have to actually lick a handful of salt. It also helps me when I get IV fluids every now and then. I hope you have found something that helps you in some way  this is a very difficult thing to live with.    Danelle   ;I was diagnosed with Orthostatic Tremors and Propriosponal Myoclonus.  I have very similar symptoms  along with blood pressure that spikes and then often goes very low.  I am taking Carvedilol and Avapro for blood pressure and Clonazepam and Keppra for the neurological conditions.  I couldn't function without these meds  but still have episodes out if the blue.  Then I need to rest for several days to regain my strength.;I have severe tachycardia upon awakening sometime middle of night followed by entire body  tremors that lasts 20-3 0 min not sure since checking time is the last thing on my mind during episodes. I am diagnosed with pots. Just started on atenolol 1/4 of 25 mg which seems to eliminate day time tachycardia. This morning episode was not expected though. Took atenolol which stopped tachycardia but not tremors. Want to try propranolol  which is systemic beta blocker vs.atenolol is a cardio beta blocker. My sister bought it for me in ukraine. They sell pretty much everything without a prescription. Dr. Svetlana Blitshteyn from NY recomended atenolol after I had a telephone consult with her. I was hoping to ride out POTS without medication. Darn it.    ;Rhonda  except for the \"high\" blood pressure  your symptoms are the same as my daughter's. She has extremely low blood pressure. She has been fainting because of it since she was 17.;Personally  I would wait until the Mayo Clinic appointment. We're probably going to be taking our 20-year-old daughter to the Mayo Clinic in December. They will have several specialists on your team to evaluate you. Don't lose hope.;My daughter was also recently diagnosed with POTS. Her cardiologist told us that the tremors are not related... NOT buying it! I have also seen videos and read many posts from others who have POTS and tremors. Don't understand how doctors can keep telling us that the tremors aren't related to POTS! My daughter is only 20 and has her whole life ahead of her... every day is such a struggle for her. She faints almost everyday  and sometimes several times a day. Midodrine and salt tablets aren't working to keep her blood pressure up enough to prevent it from bottoming out and making her faint. ;My daughter has POTS and she does the same thing. All of the Dr. tell us that it is not the POTS. It is not seizures. I have seen many people posting things like this. It is not in your head. The Dr.s have not gotten this disease figured out. There are many videos on youtube. Have strength and hang in there. Just know that it is not you  and you are not making it up.;Yes  I have been diagnosed with POTS and also have severe tremors that shake my entire body  especially from the stomach area out to the rest of my body. It can last for hours  and my blood pressure is not low during this. A clonidine transdermal patch and clonazepam help significantly. The problem with Clonazepam  though  is that it will stop working  so you have to take a small dose and taper off it when you don't need it so that it will work when you have another \"seizure\" episode. I  too  am trying to find out what can better help. Sleeping well and avoiding lots of sensory stimulation (I wear earplugs a lot) helps. I hope and pray that the medical community comes up with a good answer  but I have also received significant help from healing prayer teams such as the one at ibethel.org. You can Skype with them on Saturdays and Thursdays  and they will pray for you. ;Yes  I have been diagnosed with POTS and also have severe tremors that shake my entire body  especially from the stomach area out to the rest of my body.

Were still trying to figure it out I have them every four months an last summer lost my memory for 2 months. Anytime I have one I lose speech  being able to see or walk;Can both of you start new threads with your topics?  (Click the \"Post a Question\" button near the top of this page to do so.)  I'm afraid your posts are buried at the bottom of this outdated thread (from the summer of 08) and are not going to get the attention they deserve in our forum.      Looking forward to getting to know you both better   Heiferly.;ummm  i've read some of your comments and symptoms and I have to admit that I too have experienced this as well. After a good workout or cracking my knuckles  my thumb or middle finger will twitch like crazy. I also get this twitching feeling in my legs near my knees and in the bicep part of my arm. I recently went to a physician and was told that I have high blood pressure as well. My B/P is only 156/108 but still its abnormally high for someone my age. I haven't been to a doctor yet  so i'm wondering should I go and check this out. Please comments and concerns are welcome. ;Wow! I've been searching and searching for answers or clues to what I've been experiancing.I  have all the symtoms that rhonda talks about. I have a doctor appointment on  Thursday hoping my doctor can help me in these areas.I have first noticed these issues back in 2006 but they went away for about 2 1/2 years.Now they are back stronger than ever and I'm afraid to drive.It hurts and after the tremors or seizure like symptoms and certain parts of my body feels like it's on fire. I feel trapped in my own body but thanks for the info it was very insightful;When I first started with dysautonomia I sounded just like you  I had involuntary twitches and tremors and all the things you have that was nine months ago I was tested for everything they were so sure I had a pheochromocytoma that I was sent to NIH and tested negitive. Had very bad head tremors still have them sometimes  I was unable to walk without holding on too something and then only to bed and bathroom I thought I was going to die. I tested positive for pots too  they also thought I had to have something else besides pots  well I have been to Vanderbilt and all over the place and not one MD could tell me what I had they never thought I had MSA though. I was very weak and could not eat I lost 40 lbs and though I was going to die. I had all your symptoms and more. Slowly they have gotten better what I feel really helped me was a clonodine patch .1mg per day I can tell you when I get off of it like I had too for Vanderbilt recently it was hell. What finally made sense too me was my sympathic nervous system for some reason went haywire and they just don't know. I can tell you I am better it took me until Jan and I had been sick since May of last year  I still have a lot of issues but not like I did before I still have high heart rates at times but usually not over 110's even when I am walking. I still have tremors but not as bad as before  I still get some mini inadvertant movements but none like it was so keep you chin up I really thing you need to get on the right meds now my BP hardly ever gets above 120's over 80 unless I am having a very bad day   I drink a lot and the big difference was once I had control over my BP and heart rates I also take atenlol 12.5mg every day. I could function again so don't let them scare you it could be pots the hyperadnergic type and with the proper meds and exercise you will improve  I felt like my life was over and at times now I doo also but I keep pluggin along and everyday I see a little improvement. If you need to e mail me privately give me you e mail . ;Sounds a lot like a pheochromocytoma;Hi          Thanks for all of the information.  I have been gone for the past 9 days and haven't been able to check my email.        Ryan  I did have a 24 hr. urine test done at Cleveland Clinic and they did a Cat Scan of my abdomen to see if my adrenal gland had a tumor and it wasn't present.  I received all of my information from MAYO and they will be doing the other tests that you mentioned out there again.  I have many other tests they plan on administering  too.  My doctor just had to up my medication again as my average blood pressure during the day was 168/115 and my heart rate was 169.  I really hope they can find something to control the B/P  because if they can't it is going to damage my heart.  So  far I have been lucky and my heart is still okay  but the doctors told me that it can't withstand those numbers indefinetly.  This is the 4th time since March that they have had to double my medication.  My body seems to ignore the medication after about 3 weeks and everything starts going back up again.      Plateletgirl thanks for the information about the Marshall Protocol.  I will be looking into more information about this.  Please send me any information that you have and I will google it.  I have found that you have to be an advocate for yourself and proactive in your medical issues.  Some doctors just don't understand or think you are having anxiety attacks.  But  anxiety attacks don't happen 24/7.      I would appreciate your prayers within the next month.  I am to be weened off ALL of my medications by October 4th for my tests scheduled at MAYO.  I all ready have a difficult time and I can't imagine how things are going to be with no meds.  I look like someone having a seizure at times with the meds.  So  needless to say I am nervous about being off all meds.    Thanks for everything   Rhonda;  What Dr. Marshall also says is that the Benicar allows your immune system to 'see' and eliminate intracellular bacteria. He believes that intraceullular bacteria is the underlying cause of many illnesses.    I know if my physician had me on the Benicar and then gave me a FULL dose of Minocycline... that I would be in trouble. I had to slowly add the Minocycline to the mix and started taking only 25 MG every 48 hours. It was amazing what a small dose of minocycline along with the Benicar could do. I had herxing symptoms and felt worse as a result.    The Marshall Protocol is a research protocol. You can google for more information.;  \"Benicar  when given to healthy people  causes a very mild depression in blood pressure (the FDA has told us that it is the least effective of all the pressor drugs) and no side effects beyond dizziness. But when given to sick people  as we have found  it has a profound effect  due to the immunopathology.\"    ~Dr. Trevor Marshall  Ph.D.  ;\"I was started on 20 milligrams of Benicar  which was increased to 40 milligrams after two weeks. At the time  I also had an infection  and was taking Minocycline.\"    Hi Ryan     Thank you for your comments. I find everything you've said very interesting. I was on the  Marshall Protocol for CFS. I started out with Benicar (40 MG 3 X daily) and eventually added Minocycline to the mix. I'm wondering if your symptoms were due to severe herxing (AKA: Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction) ???"

                " Hi          I just came back from Cleveland Clinic and I tested positive on the tilt table for POTS  but they also told me that it is secondary to a primary problem.  They told me that POTS doesn't have severe tremors  body twithces  and high blood pressure.  My tremors are so severe at times that I look like I am having a seizure  but I'm not.  I get body twitches that I can not control.  My hand might just fly up in the air  sometimes it's a leg  or finger  and I've even had my entire body twitch so hard that it hurts.  If anyone else has these symptoms  please let me know and do you have a diagnosis?  Are there any meds or things out there to help with the tremors and body twitches.  They are making me very weak.  I have even fallen because my legs are shaking so bad  that they won't support me.  Thanks for any help or ideas you can give him."

                " Depression/Anxiety Physical Symptoms Hi Everyone!    I've been struggling lately after processing through a recent divorce. My wife and I have been together for about 10 years and have two young children. I moved out around January 31st and was blessed with a bout of COVID prior to leaving  which was very mild.    Anyway  in the past few months my physical symptoms have been increasing and interfere with my daily life. I am fatigued often  my legs and arms shake  feel weak  feel stiff and spasm. I feel like I cannot workout  do simple things. I have no motivation and push myself most days around mundane tasks. I've cooked one meal since being in my new space  forget to eat often and have little interest in food. I get dizzy  feel like there's a constant lump in my throat  my sleep has been affected and I have muscle aches as well. I also noticed in the past few months ringing in my ears randomly and intense brain fog/trouble focusing. Not one thing is consistent  it all comes and goes. I also went away this past weekend with my new partner and essentially felt horribly ill  spent 1/2 of one day in bed convinced I was sick  only to feel better the next day. Sometimes I just genuinely feel like I'm getting sick and it resolves. This can also cause panic on my part which clearly doesn't help.     I've had issues with anxiety and physical symptoms years ago around another time of transition and my ex wife believes all of these to be manifestations of my anxiety/depression. I've been to my doctor  the ER and urgent care. All tests and blood work are normal. I had an MRI and more bloodwork years ago when I had others symptoms around auto immune disoders  etc. Nothing seemed to be irregular.     Of course I go to a place of \"they must've missed something\" because perhaps its easier than believing my mental health can do all of this.     Has anyone had similar experiences? Can this really all be nothing truly harmful or physical? How did you cope/what did you do to manage and dig out of this?I'm sorry you are feeling so poorly.  To be honest  you sound like yes  you are having symptoms of depression and anxiety.  Covid can have after symptoms but for someone that has had covid twice  I wouldn't go there to think you do.  There are other things going on and a history with you that would make me think more mental health.  What CAN you do? Well  what about digging into the mental health aspect?  A psychologist who does dbt/cbt therapy?  That form of therapy is more than just 'tell me about your day' but instead  helps you learn how to cope with big emotions and bad feelings  problem solve your thinking about things  set goals to move past it and become your old self again.  Medication also can make a huge difference for many.  Mental health most certainly can do all you describe.  Come back and talk some more and we'll discuss!"
