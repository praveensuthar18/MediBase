                " Post gallbladder removal my 9 year old is having terrible nausea and pain My son had his gallbladder removed in January 2017 after 4 months of gallbladder attacks finally getting diagnosed with a HIDA scan of 0%.  He has done great for 8 months.  He had a couple of times of temporary stomach upset from fatty foods like ice cream.  He now wakes up every morning feeling like he needs to vomit running to the toilet.  He never vomits but coughs and welches like he is about to.  All tests come back negative.  We have done scope  ultrasound  MRCP  stomach emptying test  rounds of blood work.  We saw a different pediatric GI to see if he needs ERCP and he did not think he needs it.  His liver enzymes are normal and so are all the X-rays.    We have tried protonix  balcofen muscle relaxer  propranolol  Donnatal with no results.  We have also seen a neurologist and treated for abdominal migraines but no improvement.  He has these episodes where he gets flushed  ears get hot  BP and pulse are elevated to 130/88 and pulse can be 108.  Cardiologist said his heart is fine with an EKG and heart ultrasound.  These are the times where the stomach squeezing and nausea are worse.  It seems to be happening worse when his stomach is empty.    This last Pediatric GI is referring us to a functional abdominal pain clinic.  We have also tried doxycycline with no results.  I do not think it is IBS.  Also he has gained 18 pounds in the last 3 months which is very concerning especially on a 9 year old.  I am worried this will lead to diabetes.      Please help with any info since no doctors are helping."

But once I stood up to flush  my stool was completely normal still  (as in diarrhea normal)  but there was a dark reddish color in the entirety of the water  I did have something with quite a bit of barbeque sauce today  which I normally don't have that much with anything  it's a redd-ish brown color  Could that be it? Meds I am currently on are levothyroxine and fenofibrate. I was on buspirone but just quit that a few days ago. I did have this happen one other time a few weeks ago  but the second time after that everything was normal  so I wasn't worried. I believe at that time I was off the meds or just starting them."

                " Teratoma  What can I expect?  Very scared!! I recently found out I have a mature teratoma in the left adnexa measuring 4.3cm. No left ovarian tissue was identified. The right ovary has an anechoic cyst measuring 2.5cm. endometrium measures 7mm and my uterus measures 7.9x3.9x5.6.   I have severe OCD and anxiety and no matter how much i research and read all of your stories I cannot find comfort. I have a consultation tomorrow and i am very scared. The pain is annoying anf sometimes unbearable. I went 3 months with no period and just started bleeding very bright red and started on the 26th. I have had blood clots as well. All very bright red. Pain in my legs and pelvic area. Headaches  tired all the time. I am nausiated all the time. My blood pressure has been unusually high for myslef readin 137/95. What I'm trying to get to is....  What can I expect. I know I am going to need surgery but like I just want to know someone else out there has been through this and can talk to me about it. I feel ad though I should ask for an open surgery because I don't feel comfortable with someone using a camera to cut this out. Can I request that? Please help me with this. I am so alone and so scared.So glad to hear surgery went well and you still have your ovary. Be sure to follow the doctor's post-surgical orders so you heal properly. Hoping you will be back to normal soon!I am glad you are over the worst. You will feel just a bit better every day. Yes it is important to have the pain medication ahead of the pain. If you have gas pain walk it helps.    I just had a two hour awake surgery last week. They gave me local shots as we went. I do not like awake surgeries. I have had this particular surgery three times in three years.    I hope you heal quickly.    AlexI have had Toradol  Percocet  and morphine. Out of all of them the morphine is bringing the pain down enough to sleep. I. staying over night and obviously I cannot sleep I'm hurting so bad. Waiting for more morphine . I have staples in 5 different incisions. the right side is just painful as hell. the gas in my shoulders and back is really uncomfortable but bareable to a point   I would have to say breathing and talking is what really hurts the most.amd Omg coughing. have a pillow on your tummy at all times!!! You never know when you need to cough. and its not fun.It went very well. He was able to peel the teratoma from the ovary and saved the ovary and tube. When I woke I was quite groggy and out of it but I knew where I was. It was honestly extremely painful. My right side feels like hell which is where they pulled out the teratoma. They took the breathing tube out before I woke. I have a catheter in and I had leg compression sleeves. The surgery took him an hour. I was in the recovery room for an hour and then they brought me to my room where my husband was brought up. I was able to eat dinner. Not super easy but I could stomach real food. COFFEE  Coffee feels so great on your throat!!!! Water is great when u first wake but coffee is soothing!! Make sure you ask for your pain medicines when you start to hurt even a little. Its takes them a minute to get it. I brought my own blanket from home and its sooo nice. Not only is it more comfortable but it smells like home. :-) I'm a very very tired. Don't want to move but its good to get up and move every so often or its worse. I MADE IT!!!Thank you very much. They are doing a robotic assisted surgery which is scheduled for the 11th of November. Pre op is on the 3rd. ugh so not ready for all this. I replied to you on the Ovarian Cysts forum. Mature teratoma is another name for dermoid. These are benign cysts (non-cancerous). They are also very slow growing (1 to 2mm a year according to this link - http://radiopaedia.org/articles/mature-cystic-ovarian-teratoma) so you shouldn't need to feel rushed into having surgery if you are not comfortable with the surgeon's plan such as wanting to remove the ovary versus just the cyst. The reason the ovary cannot be seen on u/s is because the cyst is probably encapsulating it. The ovary is the size of an almond so a cyst much smaller than even 1cm could easily overtake it.     The cyst on your other ovary says it is \"anechoic\" which is an indication that it is a simple cyst which is a normal part of the menstrual cycle and therefore does not need any intervention / surgery. But they may want to remove it while they are in there (if it doesn't go away by itself beforehand) because they do sometimes continue growing instead of going away.    I hope this helps ease your mind a bit. I personally was rushed into surgery for a 9cm cyst and wish I had done things very differently. Unfortunately  far too many women lose an ovary or ovaries and even their uterus for benign ovarian cysts when JUST THE CYST should be removed. I was de-sexed (lost ovaries  tubes  and uterus) even though my cyst was benign. Every aspect of my life and health has been affected since we need our organs our whole lives for good health. They are not just for reproduction. So please do your research and protect yourself on the surgical consent form.Are you going to have some one with you at the appointment? I did not and wish I had. I would not have the open surgery if I could help it. I am not sure if a doctor would think that was a good idea. There are more complications and a much harder and longer recovery. You do not have to rush into anything. You can get a second opinion if anything does not seem right. This is not a situation where you have to have surgery yesterday. I know you are scared. Try to take it one step at a time.    Alex"

                " Could my stomach discomfort when I drink be IBS or alcohol intolerance? Every time I drink  usually between 2-4 drinks and I start to get diarrhea that I used to not get before. I do not drink often  but I am usually up late with my friends and we are just hanging out and I am going to the bathroom pretty frequently. I do not think that I drink a lot but could this be IBS or could it be a form of alcohol intolerance? I have had these symptoms and some nausea and stomach irritability just the last 4-5 I have had drinks and none of those times did I have too much to drink. All of this makes it really uncomfortable to sleep that night and most times I get little to no sleep and if I do it is only a few hours here and there.To me this sounds much more related to the alcohol and how your body reacts to it.  Do you drink the same thing each time?  Like sweet white wine gives me stomach issues where I feel like I'm going to have to go number two pronto . . . not making me the best person on a date  ha ha.  But you know what I mean.  I stopped drinking that specifically and don't have that reaction to other alcoholic beverages.  "

Like sweet white wine gives me stomach issues where I feel like I'm going to have to go number two pronto . . . not making me the best person on a date  ha ha.  But you know what I mean.  I stopped drinking that specifically and don't have that reaction to other alcoholic beverages.  "

                " Every time I drink  usually between 2-4 drinks and I start to get diarrhea that I used to not get before. I do not drink often  but I am usually up late with my friends and we are just hanging out and I am going to the bathroom pretty frequently. I do not think that I drink a lot but could this be IBS or could it be a form of alcohol intolerance? I have had these symptoms and some nausea and stomach irritability just the last 4-5 I have had drinks and none of those times did I have too much to drink. All of this makes it really uncomfortable to sleep that night and most times I get little to no sleep and if I do it is only a few hours here and there."

                " Diarrhea & Gas Pain after eating oil or animal fats A year ago now my husband (34) started experiencing a sensitivity to fats and oils. The start of this coincided with a period of time where he gained about 40lbs  overeating  and was under a lot of stress. He has since lost all of that weight and isn't under the same stress. He use to be able to enjoy a steak  now it will send him straight to the bathroom. Even if we make a pasta salad with olive oil  it will do him in. Any time he eats meat  i have to trim all fat or strain any grease  and even trace amounts sometimes get him. He\u2019s always been lactose intolerant  and occasionally overate himself into an upset stomach  but this is a daily issue now. His doctor assumed it could be bacterial  or something else and had blood labs as well as a stool sample tested. All came back clear. We\u2019re stumped as to what this could be! Any thoughts!? Thank you!I\u2019m having the same thing happen to me. I have low ejection rate from my gallbladder and now my liver enzymes indicate fatty liver. I eat healthy. My doc is still running tests but assumes it\u2019s gallbladder or bilary dyskinesia. I will need surgery. Maybe ask for a HIDA scan?"

                " Major Blood Pressure Issues Hello. I am new to the board. I am a 49 year old male with moderate/severe high blood pressure. My average for a 24 period is 150/100. I have been on several medications: Lisinopril 10 mg. (cough)  Valsartan 160 mg. (stopped working)  Medoprolol 25 mg + Amlodipine 5 mg. (stopped working)  now just Amlodipine 10 mg. Since taking the Amlodipine 10 mg. for about a week  my blood pressure keeps going higher and higher. Today readings were between 160/90 - 165/125. Also  my lower legs are sore  I have dizziness and feel light-headed  and are extremely lethargic. Is there any light at the end of the tunnel? Is there a cleaner medication with better results and less side effects. Any suggestions would be appreciated. I am desperate....HI THERE I FEEL YOUR PAIN !  YOUR STORY IS A BIT LIKE MY OWN !  Im not a doctor  but will try help.    I had the horrid barking cough with the Lisinopril too.  All the BP meds have side effects sadly. Doctors listen to your story about sides  but what can they do?  We are stuck with them to a large degree.  Yes we can swap and change meds around  but there will be sides of some sort.    A few questions     Any other health issues?  What are your blood sugars like?    Any kidney or liver problems?    How is your weight?  Do you exercise? (I know you will have had that lecture a few times  from Doc)    I see you must have had a 24hr ABPM test  as you speak of daily averages. Thats a good test to have had.    On the 24 hour test how were the night time readings? I ask as in theory they should be  lower at night  then  rising after 6AM.    Its common enough for BP to go up at night  and this is a reverse dip of the normal pattern.  BP experts are a bit more concerned about these 'reverse dippers'.  Higher night BP can be a marker for a secondary cause of High BP.  Sometimes Adrenaline issues can be at fault. Adrenal glands and Kidneys need thorough checking to outrule a secondary cause. Its worth checking this out.     Your BP as described is resistant hypertension.    Prof Morris Brown is a BP expert in Uk and its worth reading his papers on the net regarding secondary causes of BP.    There are a number of specialised tests for the adrenal problems. The high BP in these cases is caused by a small growth (*Usually non cancerous) in your Adrenal gland which secrets too much Aldosterone  causing big BP spikes. standard BP meds dont lower BP well in this case.    The medicine of choice for these is Spiro. Im on it  my BP was 180/120 on 7 BP meds a day. once the Spiro started it dropped to under 100/65  the same day!   Sometimes surgery is carried out if they are found  resulting in a probable withdrawal of BP meds.    The sides are a pain  but thats where im at.    regarding feeling dizzy etc  this may settle after a number of weeks once you adjust to the medication    Keep us posted  hope my answer was of some help  "

                " Beef Allergy? Greetings. I'm a 36 year old male with no significant health history other than being allergic to penicillin.    Last May I awoke around midnight with severe abdominal pain. My face became bright red and my arms went numb. My heart raced faster than I have ever felt it outside of running. My wife called the ambulance but by the time they got there I had had a massive bowel movement and was trending back towards normal.    It's November and I've spent months having tests done: EKG  ECG  TSH  T3  T4  stress test  upper GI  CAT scan  gastric emptying study and an electro physiology study. Everything came back normal. I've had eight of these episides. Each lasts 20 minutes roughly. My heart gets up to 140 bpm  my hands get numb  I'm extremely stuffed up  and I have to breathe deeply and slowly. BP runs 180-190 over 90 (roughly) as the episode peaks. Each time I end up having a massive bowel movement and then everything starts to subside. I shiver for about another half an hour afterwards  then I just feel kinda worn out.    The symptoms have made me very anxious and my internist at first was not alarmed but now is leaning towards panic attacks. I've taken clonazapam as soon as I start to flush and it doesn't do anything to blunt the episodes. I\"m also on 50mg metoprolol.    My wife and I have noticed that these episodes seem to come 2-4 hours after having red meat. Not always  but sometimes. We often buy the organic variety  but even then we only eat red meat a couple times per month so a pattern has been hard to identify. You hear a lot about allergic reactions to fish  venom  etc. but not much about this. I am wondering if the antibiotics that may be present in some of the meat I ingest are toxic and my body is going into emergency mode to try and expel it.    I just wanted to get some input on this if I could  it's been very stressful and the added anxiety can really get out of hand if I'm not careful.Look up alpha-gal - has to do with tick bites and meat allergies..weird - but true.Hi  it certainly sounds like you're allergic to something in the beef  & you might have given us a clue on solving it by saying you are allergic to penicillin    The beef industry in the U.S. is a heavy user of antibiotics  including penicillin. They use the stuff because they do industrial beef farming  where the cattle are crowded into gigantic factory farms & fed corn to fatten them up quickly. The problem with that is  corn is not what a cow's digestive system is designed to digest  they are adapted to eat grasses & wild grains by nature  and corn is not usually in their natural diet.    The problem with them digesting corn is  in the cow's 4 digestive 'tract' system  the corn can end up being partially or incompletely digested  which typically allows the corn to ferment in one of the 'stomachs' & allows for collection of bacteria unfriendly to a cow's digestive system. Typically this is E. coli  usually a strain that is not native to that cow  and then it tends to infect their stomach  become an abscess  or worse starts spreading throughout their system. Infected cows can get what we would call septicemia  a blood infection  or worse peritonitis  which is a general abdominal infection with the bacteria from the E. coli infections. To combat these possible deadly outcomes for the cow  the beef industry routinely give their cattle antibiotics to keep these bacterial infections at bay.    The problem with giving antibiotics to cattle are pretty much the same as giving them to people: antibiotics tend to kill off the 'good' bacteria in the gut as well as the harmful bacteria causing the infection the doctors prescribe the antibiotics to a patient to kill off  thereby saving the person from dying from the bad bacteria infection. So antibiotics are sort of a necessary evil  that need to be taken in cases of infection by some pretty nasty bugs. The downside to them is  they mess up the digestive system for a while  leaving us with diarrhea until our guts fill back up again with the friendly bacteria our colons need to be able to digest what we eat.    So let's take a look at what the beef industry is doing here: they are feeding cattle food they would not naturally eat  that is difficult for them to digest  & which tend to cause them to incur infections in their digestive tract  leading to infections which can sicken them or kill them fairly quickly - and so their solution to the almost inevitable bacterial infections the cattle develop is to feed the cattle antibiotics  which suppress the bad & good bacteria in the cow's digestive tract  thereby weakening the cattle's ability to digest food & inevitably making the cow more prone to developing further infections when fed the corn diet they don't usually eat!    The further problem with all this is  when the cattle are slaughtered most of them contain remnants of the antibiotics in the beef produced from them  so you may not know this  but when you are eating beef in most cases you are unintentionally eating some kind of antibiotic the cow was fed in the days before it was slaughtered.    The fact that your gut is blowing up almost like clockwork after eating beef is your clue as to what is going on here. My guess is you are being exposed to penicillin in the beef you are eating (& other antibiotics besides penicillin & most antibiotics are chemically similar to penicillin  so you better be careful or you could end up allergic to more then just penicillin) & you are just reacting violently to the allergic reaction as you described it.    You know  there are alternatives to beef  -)    I almost never eat beef & I do very well. In fact I eat a rice  beans & corn diet daily to make sure I get a full veggie method of obtaining the necessary amino acids to make protein each day. I'm a chili freak  love the stuff  but I usually put a boiled half chicken breast in the pot of chili I cook each week. The chicken ends up being flavor mostly rather then a source of protein for me. If I leave the chicken out of the chili I function fine  as if I eat meat each day just off the rice-beans-corn alone. Like I say  the chicken I add to my chili tends to work merely as an extra flavor in the ingredients :-)    The advantage to this kind of eating is  plants sort of ignore antibiotics like penicillin & it is a waste of time to give them to agricultural type veggie plants anyway  so there's no problem there. The big downside is eating commercially grown veggies  which tend to be pesticide coated  but there are ways to clean beans so they are fairly pesticide free & the best practice for all veggies is to wash  wash  wash them well in advance. And of course there are the more expensive organic veggies :-)    But if you are a beef lover you might try some of the grass fed 'free range' beef at Whole Foods  or similar upscale markets. I'm not very good with beef  from celiac disease  but I've tried their grass fed stuff  & I seemed to do ok with it. But really you need organic beef  not the commercial stuff  which is going to be the most likely to be antibiotic infected before you eat it :-/    But protein is protein imo. When you look at how it is put together  every species on the planet uses essentially the same amino acid schemes to assemble proteins. The trick for we humans is to get the essential amino acids we need from the protein we eat. It is a neat trick to do to be able to get the same amino acids from veggies as you would get from a steak from veggies as simple as rice beans & corn :-) of course eggs are the 'perfect' source of protein & amino acids  that all other food sources are measured by  and if you aren't allergic to eggs  I think 1 egg a day is enough to keep you with the amino acids you need each day. Of course there aren't many calories in a single egg a day  so you need to eat other foods besides an egg each day  not to mention there are very little carbohydrates in the things. But you get the idea  in cases of amino acid deficiency  if the person is not allergic to eggs  the quickest way to get them back to good health is feed them eggs :-)    But I'm bad with fish  allergic to the stuff  so that's out for me. But for you  I don't know. What I do know is  there are alternatives to beef :-)    Ok I hope this helps  sorry I got wordy with it  good luck :-)"
